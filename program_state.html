		Program State and Basic Variables</h1>

		<h2>The Concept of State</h2>

		<p>As we know, programs execute statements in sequential order. They flow through your code, left to right, top to bottom. As statements are executed, things happen: output is issued, calculations are done, and the <strong>state</strong> of your program changes. But what is state?
		Loosely put, state refers to all the data your program is dealing with
		and their <strong>current</strong> values at the point in time when a
		particular statement is about to be executed. Since the entire point of a program is to transform input data into some meaningful output data, it stands to reason that the program's state will change as it executes statements. We need a way to record the state of our program in manageable units. We shall call these units
		<strong>variables</strong>, since their values may vary as our program executes.</p>


		<p>Variables each have a name, a type, and a value. A name is simply
		what we choose to call a particular piece of data. For example, we
		previously called the bit of data representing the total number of
		apples held by everyone 'apples'. We stored a number in 'apples', so this would be its type. The value of 'apples' started at 0. As more people were input into the problem, the number of apples
		increased. Accordingly, the value of our variable
		'apples' changed.</p>

		<p><strong>Type</strong> refers to the type of value a variable can
		have. Text is not the same as a number, thus they are considered
		different types. One could not for example add "apples" to the number
		7. Python has five basic types:</p>

		<dl>
		
			<dt>int</dt>

			<dd>Integers, e.g. 1, 179835646, -3, 0</dd>

			<dt>string</dt>

			<dd>Text strings, e.g. 'Alice', "The cat sat on the mat"</dd>

			<dt>float</dt>

			<dd>Real numbers, e.g. 0.0, 48747.23501, -0.5</dd>

			<dt>bool</dt>

			<dd>Boolean conditions, e.g. True, False</dd>

			<dt>None</dt>

			<dd>None is used to specify a variable which has no type or actual value.</dd>
		
		</dl>

		<h2>Assignment Statements</h2>

		<p>To create a new variable, we simply <strong>assign</strong>
		it a value, by giving it a name and setting the name equal to the
		value. We do this by using the <strong>assignment statement</strong>
		which takes the form</p>

		<div class="centered">
			<em>variable_name = expression</em>
		</div>

		<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; name = "James"
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

		<p>Here we have created a new variable, whose name is 'name', and which
		has the value <em>James</em>. Note, we did not explicitly state the type of
		'name' to be a string. When
		assigning a value to a variable, Python automatically sets the type of
		variable being assigned to the type of the value being assigned. If we
		go on to assign name again, this time with a different value</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; name = "Jimbo"
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

		<p>the value of 'name' will be changed. If we want to see what the value of
		a variable is we can simply print it:</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; print("name")
Jimbo
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

		<p>James has disappeared. As far as the program is concerned James was
		never there. There is no James! Assigning a new value to a variable
		will obliterate the previous value of that variable. If you wish to
		keep the old value of a variable you need to save a copy, in a
		different variable.</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; i = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; j = i
&gt;&gt;&gt; i = 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; print("i =", i, "and j =", j)
i = 2 and j = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

		<p>Let's look at what we've done, step by step.</p>

		<ol>

			<li><code>i = 1</code><br />

			We create a new variable, called 'i', assign it a value of
			<em>1</em>, and python sets it's type to 'int'</li>

			<li><code>j = i</code><br />

			We create another new variable, this time called 'j', assign it a
			value of ... well what exactly? <code>i</code> is not a string
			because it's not in quotes, and it's not a number, so it's being
			treated as a variable. But what is 'i'? Variables are implicitly
			considered to be their current values. So <code>i</code> is
			implicitly considered to be 1 (it's current value)</li>

			<li><code>i = 2</code><br />

			We assign a new value to 'i'. The old value of 'i' is
			discarded.</li>

			<li><code>print("i =", i, "and j =", j)</code><br />

			We output the current values of 'i' and 'j' respectively.</li>

		</ol>

		<p>Step 2 highlights a number of important points about assignment. The
		assignment statement does something very specific. It changes the
		current value of the variable being assigned to the value of the
		expression to the right of the equals. This means that the value of the
		expression is determined before actually changing the value of the
		variable. As you can see from the output produced by our little
		program, assignments do not behave in the same way as a
		similar statement in maths does. <code>j = i</code> does not mean that
		'j' and 'i' are always equivalent. The only thing that can be certainly
		said about the relationship between 'j' and 'i' is that they will be
		equal directly after the assignment statement has been executed. Both
		before and after that point in time, all bets are off.</p>

		<div class="centered">

			An assignment is <strong>not</strong> a description of a
			relationship between two expressions.<br /> It effects a
			<strong>once off</strong> change in the value of one variable.

		</div>

		<p>Consider the assignment statement <code>x = x + 1</code>. For those
		of you with inner mathematicians that are screaming loudly to get out,
		take a large stiff drink now! What we have is an assignment to a
		variable ('x') the value of an expression ('x + 1'). Let us suppose
		that currently the value of 'x' is 1. This assignment occurs as
		follows.</p>

		<ol>

			<li><code>x = x + 1</code><br />

			The value of the expression 'x + 1' is determined. Since 'x' is 1, we can transform the expression into '1 + 1' since variables in expressions are considered to have their
			current value.</li>

			<li><code>x = 1 + 1</code><br />

			This is obviously 2, hence the value of the expression overall is
			2.</li>

			<li><code>x = 2</code><br />
	
			2 is assigned as the <strong>new</strong> value of 'x'.</li>

		</ol>

		<h2>Integers, Floats and Arithmetic Expressions</h2>

		<p>Obviously we want to be able do more than simply assign values to
		variables. We need to be able to manipulate and combine them in various
		ways. For integers and floats this leads directly to arithmetic
		notation, and its representations in Python. In general, basic arithmetic expressions can be formed in much the same way as one would express them mathematically. If 'x' and 'y' are either
		integers or floats then</p>

		<ul>
			<li><code>x + y</code> yields Addition</li>

			<li><code>x - y</code> yields Subtraction</li>

			<li><code>x * y</code> yields Multiplication</li>

			<li><code>x / y</code> yields Division</li>

			<li><code>x % y</code> yields Modulo (or Remainder)</li>

			<li><code>x ** y</code> yields Exponentiation (or raising to the power of)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The above list describes various <strong>operators</strong> that can
		be used to form arithmetic expressions. But, suppose we have the
		expression <code>2+3*4</code>. Which of the addition or the
		multiplication operators is applied first? One might think the
		operators are applied simply left to right, but as in maths, we
		have a well defined order of <strong>precedence</strong> specifying
		the order in which operators are applied. The complete list of
		Python operators and their precedence can be found <a class="doclink"
		href="http://olympiad.cs.uct.ac.za/docs/python-docs-2.6/reference/expressions.html#summary">here</a>. In general
		Python arithmetic operates exactly as it would in normal
		mathematics.</p>

		<p>In the same way variables have a type, so too expressions have a
		type associated with their value. The type of the value of an
		expression is generally determined by the types comprising the
		expression. For example, adding one integer to another in an expression
		always yields an integer, so the expression's type is integer. But what
		happens when you mix two, or more, types in an expression? In general,
		all participating sub-expressions have their type promoted to the most
		general type. By general, we mean 'most capable of representing all
		types involved'. For example, the value 0.5 cannot be represented by an
		integer, but the value 3 can be represented by a float as 3.0. Hence
		adding a float to an integer means the integer gets promoted to a float
		and the type of the expression's value as a whole will be a float.
		Division however acts slightly differently:</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(4/2)
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(5/2)
2
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

		<p>Four divided by two is two, no problems there. But five divided two
		is 2.5, not 2! Because both 5 and 2 are integers, python divides them
		as integers, in much the same way as we did in junior school. The
		number of times 2 goes into 5 completely is worked out, and the rest is
		considered the remainder. Because an integer can't represent the
		additional 0.5, it is simply dropped. If you want the exact value,
		divide by a float instead, and force promotion of the expression to a
		float:</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(5/2.0)
2.5
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

		<p>However, we often actually want the integer part of a division only,
		or the remainder. Python provides us with an operator to
		get the remainder, namely modulo:</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(5 % 2)
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; print("5 divided by 2 is ", 5/2, "remainder", 5 % 2)
5 divided by 2 is 2 remainder 1
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

		<h2>Strings and common operators</h2>

		<p>Strings can be manipulated too, but the operations we perform on
		them are fundamentally different. Assuming 's1' and 's2' are strings,
		and 'i' and 'j' are integers</p>

		<ul>
			<li><code>s1 + s2</code> yields Concatenation<br />
			This joining of two strings in the order they are listed as operands
			to from a single string; e.g. <code>"a"+"b"</code> yields "ab"</li>

			<li><code>s1 * i</code> yields Repetition<br />
			The creation of a new string repeated 'i' times; e.g. <code>"a" *
			3</code> yields "aaa"</li>

			<li><code>s1[i]</code> yields Subscription (or indexing)<br />
			The extraction of a single character at a specific position in the
			string, where the first character in the string is a position 0,
			the second and position 1, and so on; e.g. <code>"abc"[1]</code>
			yields "b". 'i' may be any expression evaluating to an integer.
			Negative numbers may be used, where <code>-i</code> means the i'th
			last position.</li>

			<li><code>s1[i:j:k]</code> yields Slicing<br />
			The extraction of a series of characters from a string starting at
			the character in the i'th position and continuing until the
			character just prior to the j'th position, extracting only every
			k'th character, where positions are numbered from 0, and negative
			numbers mean distance from end of string. Any of i, j, or k may be
			omitted, in which case i is treated as 0, j as the string length, and
			k as 1.  A k value of 1 means all characters in the
			specified range are extracted. If j is omitted, the extraction is
			from the i'th position to the end of the string.  Examples:<br />

			<code>"The <b>quick brown fox</b>"[4:]</code> yields "quick brown fox"<br />
			<code>"The quick brown<b> fox</b>"[-4:]</code> yields " fox"<br />
			<code>"<b>The </b>quick brown fox"[:4]</code> yields "The "<br />
			<code>"The <b>quick</b> brown fox"[4:9]</code> yields "quick".<br />
			<code>"<b>T</b>h<b>e</b> <b>q</b>u<b>i</b>c<b>k</b> <b>b</b>r<b>o</b>w<b>n</b> <b>f</b>o<b>x</b>"[::2]</code> yields "Teqikbonfx"<br />
			<code>"The <b>q</b>ui<b>c</b>k <b>b</b>ro<b>w</b>n fox"[4:15:3]</code> yields "qcbw".<br /></li>

			<li><code>s1[:]</code> yields Slicing of the entire string,
			essentially making a complete copy of the string.</li>

		</ul>

		<h2>Formalisation of the Concepts of Statements and Expressions</h2>

		<p>To recap:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Programs consist of sequences of statements</li>

			<li>Statements perform actions but do not have value</li>

			<li>Statements may act on expressions</li>

			<li>Expressions have a value, and when used in statements, their value is determined and substituted in place of the expression</li>

			<li>Expressions may be simple expressions such as numbers or variables whose values can be determined directly</li>

			<li>Expressions may be composed of simpler expressions combined using appropriate operators</li>
		</ol>
