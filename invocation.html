		<h2>Starting the interactive shell</h2>

		<p>Starting python is easy.</p>

		<ol>
			<li>We will be using IDLE to get things started</li>

			<li>On the Desktop you will see a link named "Python"</li>

			<li>To open the Interpreter click on <strong>"Run" > "Python Shell"</strong></li>

			<li>The screen will open up and look similar to the following</li>


		</ol>

		<!--<p>Similarly from a terminal in Linux simply type <code>python</code> and press Enter.</p>-->

		<pre class="listing">
Python 2.6.4 (r264:75706, Dec 7 2009, 18:43:55) [MSC v.1310 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
Type "copyright", "credits" or "license()" for more information.
 
    ****************************************************************
    Personal firewall software may warn about the connection IDLE
    makes to its subprocess using this computer's internal loopback
    interface.  This connection is not visible on any external
    interface and no data is sent to or received from the Internet.

IDLE 2.6.4      ==== No Subprocess ====

</pre>

		<p>What you see now is known as the python interactive shell. The first
		line tells you what version of python you are running. The second line
		gives you some information about how this particular copy of python was
		built, and on what system it is running. The third line lists some
		commands you can use to get more information. Whilst in the interactive
		shell, you can enter python expressions and see their results
		immediately. Try it now: type in a simple mathematical expression such
		as <code>4 + 7</code>.</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; 4 + 7
11
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

		<p>As you can see, the answer or result of the expression is printed
		out, and you are returned to the prompt "&gt;&gt;&gt;". Now try
		something different: type in <code>a = 2 + 7</code>.  Then, on the
		next line, type just <code>a</code>.</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 2 + 7
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
9
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

		<p>This should be somewhat familiar from the end of the basic concepts
		section, where we were assigning a value to a name. In this case the
		name is 'a' and the value is the result of '2 + 7'. Note that no value
		is printed out immediately after the assignment. The interactive shell
		always prints out the value of expressions, but not of statements. This
		means however that the labels to which we assign values, more correctly
		called <strong>variables</strong>, are expressions that evaluate to a
		value, which is why it printed out <code>9</code> when we input <code>
		a</code>.</p>


		<h2>Running a saved python script</h2>

		<p>Whilst ideal as a calculator and for exploring new ideas quickly, it
		would be pretty tedious if we had to re-enter our program into the
		interactive shell every time we wanted to run it. So instead we can,
		and in fact most often will, save our program code to a file. Program
		source code is plain raw text. As such word processors like Microsoft
		Word, Wordperfect and Open Office are not suitable to the task. We will
		look for Idle which is specifically geared towards creating python programs,
		and comes with python. </p>

		<p>So now, instead of running the interactive shell, let's write our
		first python program (also known as a 'script'). Open up the first
		window again and do the following:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Click on <strong>"File" > "Save"</strong></li>

			<li>Navigate to F:</li>

			<li>Save the file as <strong>"hello.py"</strong></li>

			<li>Type the following:</li>

		</ol>

<pre class='listing'>
print "Hello World!"

</pre>
		<p>Hit F5, or Click <strong>"Run" > "Run Module"</strong> to 
		run your program.<p>

<pre class='listing'>
>>>
Hello World!
>>>
</pre>

		<p>This is a very simple program, but it should help you get the 
		idea. The computer is only following the instructions you provided
		to it. Lets convert the test we did on the Interpreter to a program.
		Save it as 'second.py'
		</p>



		<pre class='listing'>
# My second python program
4 + 7 # This should add two numbers and output the result
a = 2 + 7
a
</pre>

		<p>Notice the first and second lines. They contain what are called
		<strong>comments</strong>. Any text following a hash character ("#") on a
		line in a python program is a comment, including the hash itself.
		Comments are completely ignored by python, and are there purely to
		annotate code and make things easier for humans reading the code. We
		use comments to place small reminders within the code for ourselves, or
		explain the logic behind particularly tricky sections. As we
		progress through the course, you will find the code examples used are
		sprinkled more and more liberally with comments explaining how they
		work.</p>

		<p>Now it would be reasonable to expect that if we ran this program we
		would get the same results as given to us by the interactive shell. So,
		let's try it. 

		<pre class='listing'>
>>>
>>>
</pre>

		<p>No output? Nothing? The python interpreter (python), when called
		without a file name following it, starts up in the interactive shell. Only
		then will it output the results of expressions entered. When invoked
		with the name of a file containing python code, python will only
		produce output if explicitly told to do so. So, let's use a trick from
		our first program. Modify the code so it looks like the following:</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
# My second python program
4 + 7 # This should add two numbers and output the result
a = 2 + 7
print a
</pre>

		<pre class='listing'>
>>>
9
>>>
</pre>

		<p>Ah, that's better. Again, you should recognise the print statement
		from the end of the basic concepts section. The print statement will be
		explained in greater detail the next section.</p>

		<p>One more important consideration is that python is <strong>case
		sensitive</strong>. A variable 'a' and another variable 'A' are not the
		same, as illustrated below ...</p>
		
		<pre class='listing'>
# This program illustrates how python is case sensitive

a = 3 # assign a the value 3
A = "Hi" # assign A the value "Hi"

# Check whether assigning to A has changed a
print a

# Check that A and a are still different
print "A = ", A, " and  a = ", a
</pre>

		<p>Running this produces the output:</p>
		
<pre class='listing'>
3
A = Hi  and  a = 3
</pre>

		<ol start='7'>

				<li>For each of these three lines, which are expressions and
				which are statements?</li>

				python interactive interpreter?</li>

				file/script?</li>

				<li>What changes need to be made to produce output when I run
				these lines from a file/script?</li>
