  <h1>Introductory Programming in Python: Lesson 4<br />
    Basic Input</h1>

  <h2>Literal Values</h2>

  <p>So far our programs have been pretty uninteresting. They
    consistently produce the same results because they consistently act on
    the same data, or input, which we have specified by <strong>hard
      coding</strong> values for our inputs in the form of
    <strong>literals</strong>. A 'constant' or 'literal' is sort of the opposite to a
    variable, in that its value does not change over the course of program
    execution, and more importantly, its value is specified
    <em>literally</em>, within the program code.</p>

  <p>As mentioned before, Python understands a fairly limited set of key
    words and symbols as basic statements or operators. Previously, we
    said that python treats unrecognised words (used is a very loose sense)
    as variable names, but this is not strictly true. Python treats
    unrecognised words as expressions, and attempts to determine their
    value. Now, the word can specify a value directly, in which case it
    called a literal value, or simply 'literal' for short. </p>

<pre class='listing'>
#An example differentiating literals and variables
a = 3                #a is a variable name, 3 is an integer literal
b = 'b'              #b is a variable name, 'b' is a string literal
c = True             #c is a variable name, True is a boolean literal
if 3*'b' == a*b:     #3 and 'b' are literals, a and b are variables
    print(c)         #is c literal or variable?
else:                
    print "False"    #is "False" a literal or a variable?

#Are False and "False" the same?
</pre>

  <h2>The input() Function</h2>

  <p>It's not very helpful to us if we must change our programs every
    time we want to change the data they work with. So instead we want to
    be able to tell our program to get input from somewhere. The simplest
    place to get input from is the keyboard, in the form of text entered by
    the user. Python provides a <strong>function</strong> to do just this,
    called input():</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; name = input("What is your name? ")
What is your name? James
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(name)
James
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

  <p>We've seen 'input' before in the basic concepts section, and
    there really isn't much to it. Just a few things to note.
    Firstly, input is a function. A function is a defined collection of
    statements that produce or <strong>return</strong> a value when
    executed. You could think of them as a way of turning a small set of
    statements into an expression. We will learn how to define our own
    functions later on in the course, but Python provides quite a few basic
    built in ones which we are going to be using before that, so let's look
    briefly at how they work.</p>

  <ul>

    <li><code>input</code> is the name of the function. Like
      variables, functions have names to identify them. Like a variable,
      a function name is a label that points to the collection of
      statements to be executed.</li>

    <li>To execute the statements in a function, better known as
      <strong>calling a function</strong> we write the function's name
      followed by round brackets. <code>input()</code></li>

    <li>Using the name just by itself treats the function like a
      variable. </li>

    <li><code>"What is your name? "</code> is a parameter to the
      function. Functions are like mini programs. They always do the same
      thing, but they can do the same thing to different data. We put the
      data we want a function to operate on in between the brackets when
      we call it. Expressions and variables <strong>passed</strong> to
      functions in this way are temporarily known as
      <strong>parameters</strong>. Multiple parameters can be passed to a
      function by separating them with commas, and in general any valid
      expression is a valid parameter; e.g.<br /> <code>minimum(6, 2,
        3+4, 4**2, 8.3, 3*1)</code><br /> has six parameters, some of which
      are not just simple expressions like plain numbers.</li>

    <li>Despite the fact that any valid expression is a valid
      parameter, functions are usually quite picky about the parameters
      they can work with. For example, we couldn't find them minimum of a
      collection of strings. That only really works with integers and
      floats. Functions usually specify the <em>number</em> of parameters
      they accept. Often functions may accept less parameters than they
      specifically ask for, by substituting default values for the
      parameters not provided. </li>

  </ul>

  <p>Back to 'input'! 'input' captures a single line of text from
    the keyboard, as entered by the user. It returns a string containing
    the captured text, leaving out the "\n" produced when the user hits the
    Enter key. In addition, it takes one optional parameter, which is
    displayed as a prompt prior to accepting input from keyboard. If this
    parameter is left out, the default prompt is an empty string, so
    nothing is printed.</p>

  <h2>Exercises</h2>

  <ol>

    <li>If there is a function named <em>my_function</em>, how do I call
      it?</li>

    <li>Are functions expressions or statements? What about when they
      are called?</li>

    <li>Start the python interactive interpreter:

      <ol>

        <li>Assign what the user types to a variable called
          's'.</li>

        <li>Print the value of the variable s.</li>

        <li>Print 's'.</li>

        <li>Use input() to prompt the user for a number, get that number, and assign it to a variable called 'n'.</li>

        <li>Print double the value of the variable 'n'.</li>

      </ol>

      Exit the python interactive interpreter.

    </li>

    <li>Write a program that asks the user for their name and
      stores it in a variable. Then output "Hello", followed by the
      user's name</li>

    <li>Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, and
      prints the sum of those two numbers.</li>

    <li>Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, and
      prints the difference of those two numbers.</li>

    <li>Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, and
      prints the product of those two numbers. Are you sensing a pattern
      here?</li>

    <li>Write a program that asks the user for some text, and a number.
      The program prints out the text a number of times equal to the
      number entered, without line breaks or spaces in between each
      repetition.</li>

  </ol>
