		<h2>Literal Values</h2>

		<p>So far our programs have been pretty uninteresting. They
		consistently produce the same results because they consistently act on
		the same data, or input, which we have specified by <strong>hard
		coding</strong> values for our inputs in the form of
		<strong>literals</strong>. A 'constant' or 'literal' is sort of the opposite to a
		variable, in that its value does not change over the course of program
		execution, and more importantly, its value is specified
		<em>literally</em>, within the program code.</p>

		<p>As mentioned before, Python understands a fairly limited set of key
		words and symbols as atomic statements or operators. Previously, we
		said that python treats unrecognised words (used is a very loose sense)
		as variable names, but this is not strictly true. Python treats
		unrecognised words as expressions, and attempts to determine their
		value. Now, the word can specify a value directly, in which case it
		called a literal value, or simply 'literal' for short. Only if the word
		isn't a literal, does Python treat is as a literal.</p>

<pre class='listing'>
#An example differentiating literals and variables
a = 3                #a is a variable name, 3 is an integer literal
b = 'b'              #b is a variable name, 'b' is a string literal
c = True             #c is a variable name, True is a boolean literal
if 3*'b' == a*b:     #3 and 'b' are literals, a and b are variables
    print c          #is c literal or variable?
else:                
    print "False"    #is "False" a literal or a variable?

#Are False and "False" the same?
</pre>

		<h2>The input() Function</h2>

		<p>It's not very helpful to us if we must change our programs every
		time we want to change the data they work with. So instead we want to
		be able to tell our program to get input from somewhere. The simplest
		place to get input from is the keyboard, in the form of text entered by
		the user. Python provides a <strong>function</strong> to do just this,
		called <a class="doclink"
		href="http://docs.python.org/lib/built-in-funcs.html">input</a>:</p>

</pre>

		<p>We've seen 'input' before in the basic concepts section, and
		there really isn't much to it. Just a few things to note really.
		Firstly, input is a function. A function is a defined collection of
		statements that produce or <strong>return</strong> a value when
		executed. You could think of them as a way of turning a small set of
		statements into an expression. We will learn how to define our own
		functions later on in the course, but Python provides quite a few basic
		built in ones which we are going to be using before that, so let's look
		briefly at how they work.</p>

		<ul>

			<li><code>input</code> is the name of the function. Like
			variables, functions have names to identify them. Like a variable,
			a function name is a label that points to the collection of
			statements to be executed.</li>

			<li>To execute the statements in a function, better known as
			<strong>calling a function</strong> we write the function's name
			followed by round brackets. <code>input()</code></li>

			<li>Using the name just by itself treats the function like a
			variable. <!--Functions, when not called, are also expressions and
			have a value. Their value in this case just happens to be the
			function itself.--></li>

			<li><code>"What is your name? "</code> is a parameter to the
			function. Functions are like mini programs. They always do the same
			thing, but they can do the same thing to different data. We put the
			data we want a function to operate on in between the brackets when
			we call it. Expressions and variables <strong>passed</strong> to
			functions in this way are temporarily known as
			<strong>parameters</strong>. Multiple parameters can be passed to a
			function by separating them with commas, and in general any valid
			expression is a valid parameter; e.g.<br /> <code>minimum(6, 2,
			3+4, 4**2, 8.3, 3*1)</code><br /> has six parameters, some of which
			are not just simple expressions like plain numbers.</li>

			<li>Despite the fact that any valid expression is a valid
			parameter, functions are usually quite picky about the parameters
			they can work with. For example, we couldn't find them minimum of a
			collection of strings. That only really works with integers and
			floats. Functions usually specify the <em>number</em> of parameters
			they accept. Often functions may accept less parameters than they
			specifically ask for, by substituting default values for the
			parameters not provided. Such is the case with 'input',
			speaking of which, we digress.</li>

		</ul>

		<p>Back to 'input'! 'input' captures a single line of text from
		the keyboard, as entered by the user. It returns a string containing
		the captured text, leaving out the "\n" produced when the user hits the
		Enter key. In addition, it takes one optional parameter, which is
		displayed as a prompt prior to accepting input from keyboard. If this
		parameter is left out, the default prompt is an empty string, so
		nothing is printed.</p>

		<h2>Exercises</h2>

		<ol>

			<li>If there is a function named <em>my_function</em>, how do I call
			it?</li>

			<li>Are functions expressions or statements? What about when they
			are called?</li>

			<li>Start the python interactive interpreter:
				
				<ol>

					<li>Assign what the user types to a variable called
					's'.</li>

					<li>Print the value of the variable s.</li>

					<li>Print 's'.</li>

					<li>Use input() to prompt the user for a number, get that number, and assign it to a variable called 'n'.</li>

					<li>Print double the value of the variable 'n'.</li>

				</ol>

				Exit the python interactive interpreter.
			
			</li>

			<li>Write a program that asks the user user for their name and
			stores it in a variable. Then output "Hello", followed by the
			user's name</li>

			<li>Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, and
			prints the sum of those two numbers.</li>

			<li>Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, and
			prints the difference of those two numbers.</li>

			<li>Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, and
			prints the product of those two numbers. Are you sensing a pattern
			here?</li>

			<li>Write a program that asks the user for some text, and a number.
			The program prints out the text a number of times equal to the
			number entered, without line breaks or spaces in between each
			repetition.</li>

		</ol>
