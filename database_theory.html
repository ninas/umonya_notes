		<h2>The Need for Databases</h2>

		<p>Technically, the word '<a
		href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a>' refers to
		any collection of structured data stored on a permanent medium. Early
		on in the programming days, it was realised that a whole bunch of time
		and effort was spent dealing with the recurring problem of permanent
		storage of data, and its efficient retrieval. Every program that
		required permanent storage of some sort would have to have specialised
		code written to deal with the low level management of the physical
		device, e.g. magnetic tape, disk drive, etc... It was soon recognised
		that an abstracted method of dealing with off-line storage was required
		and thus the concept of the database was born. The first 'databases'
		barely qualified to hold the name, and were in fact nothing but flat
		unstructured file systems managed by operating systems. These days the
		word 'database' implies a separate piece of software that manages a
		structured method of storage on top of any underlying file system, but
		those initial flat file systems were the beginning of the abstraction
		process. With them in place, programmers no longer needed to deal with
		writing to and from specific sectors of a tape or disk themselves, they
		could let the operating system handle it. It was very quickly
		discovered, however, that the flat file system model was insufficient,
		and at this point the evolution of databases split into two primary
		paths. The first path being the so called 'flat' model, which is
		basically an extension of the flat file system, and the second being
		the hierarchical model.</p>
		
		<h2>The Flat Model</h2>

		<p>In a flat file system each unit of data could be stored in it's own
		file, e.g. each customer's details could be stored in it's own file
		using the customer's account number as the file name. This approach is
		capable of dealing with a single dataset reasonably well, but provides
		no way to distinguish between multiple datasets. Consider the customer
		record example again, but now extend the idea to managing those records
		over a number of years. If we wanted to break the financials of the
		business into financial years for tax purposes, we have no way to
		determine which customer record file belongs in which year, or which
		transaction file belongs in which year. There are methods to make the
		distinction, but they are complex and unwieldy at best. Instead the
		concept of the structured file was developed. Using structured files,
		one could store multiple records within a single file, and then separate
		datasets, e.g. financial years, from one another by collecting multiple
		records belonging to a particular dataset into a single structured file,
		and each dataset would be in it's own file. This provided two major
		advantages. Firstly, the logical separation was useful to both programmers
		and users alike. Secondly, dealing with smaller datasets provides marked
		speed increases.</p>

		<p>Structured files come in a variety of <strong>formats</strong>. All
		formats however share some common concepts, although individual
		implementations may differ. All structured files need some way of
		specifying when a record ends and a new one begins, and also a method of
		specifying within a record when a field, or attribute, ends and another
		begins. Some formats extend the second principle by allowing attributes
		to be named flexibly, as in the case of the first database
		applications, a la Dbase.</p>

		<p>Structured formats tend to be in human readable form, i.e. they are
		text files obeying certain formatting conventions, but they may be binary
		as well. Text based files have a number of advantages:</p>

		<ul>

			<li>They are human readable, and human editable, usually by manner
			of white space delimiters.</li>

			<li>They are operating system and platform independent.</li>

			<li>They are machine readable, and machine processable, by manner of
			specific field/record delimiters.</li>

		</ul>

		<p>On the other hand, they have a number of disadvantages too:</p>

		<ul>

			<li>Writing parsers for text formats can become arbitrarily complex,
			depending on the format.</li>

			<li>Implementing higher level structure (above that of fields and
			records) is difficult, and drastically increases parser complexity,
			and processing time.</li>

			<li>Difficult to maintain effective cross-referencing and record
			identification. Consider the effects of using a species name
			somewhere; one record may record species as 'hippo', another as
			'hippopotamus', yet another might use the taxonomic name, and of
			course human error must always be taken into account: 'hippoppotamus'.</li>

		</ul>

		<p>A number of these problems can be dealt with indirectly; standardised
		parsers can written, formats can be agreed upon in standards
		committees, and controlled vocabularies or ontologies created to
		'enforce' consistent usage of terminologies. But human error cannot be
		eliminated.</p>

		<p>The bioinformatics field, in particular, uses delimited files
		extensively, with a bewildering number of different formats. EMBL,
		Genbank, protein databank and a fasta files are but a few examples of
		such structured formats.</p>

		<h2>Spreadsheets</h2>

		<p>While originally developed for accounting and financial purposes, the
		spreadsheet has been co-opted for alternative use far more than any
		other generic 'office application'. The reason for this is that they
		visually represent the tabular structure of records and fields as rows
		and columns respectively. While each different spreadsheet application
		uses it's own format, they are generally capable of importing and
		exporting flat textual files in the form of 'comma separated values'
		(CSV) files and tab (or other special character) delimited files. In
		addition the spreadsheet applications themselves provide basic tools for
		manipulating the dataset, including easy editing of particular fields
		without worrying about underlying text formats, sorting, filtering, and
		basic mathematics. We'll learn more about spreadsheets as databases and
		why they're a bad idea shortly.</p>
		
		<h2>XML</h2>

		<p>In recent years, the eXtensible Markup Language (<a
		href='http://www.w3.org/XML' class='doclink'>XML</a>) format has become
		a de facto standard for textual database storage. It extends the true
		flat textual format from simple records and fields to a hierarchical
		textual format, using 'tags' which can enclose (and hence imply
		containment, and thence hierarchy) text or other tags. Tags may in
		addition have arbitrary attributes associated with them, imparting
		meta-information about the tag itself, or even actual data.</p>

		<p>An extensive look at XML and its uses is not worth repeating in these
		notes, as the topic is well covered elsewhere. An excellent tutorial on
		the practicalities of coding XML by hand, written by spiderpro is
		available <a href='data/kickstart_xml_tutorial.pdf'
		class='doclink'>here</a>.</p>

		<h2>The Hierarchical Model</h2>
		
		<p>The second path of evolution from simple flat file systems was the
		hierarchical database. It provided a means of partitioning sub-datasets
		in the form of identifiable records, and expressing in a limited, but
		explicit, manner the relationships between records by grouping
		collections of records together, subordinate to parent records. Each
		group could then be further grouped together with similar groups, and
		with additional meta data about those groups in higher level groups;
		e.g.  each customer had a file, and these files were grouped together
		by the customer's home branch (a directory), which were in turn grouped
		together in regions.  The hierarchical model provided a simple way to
		allow speedy navigation of the database by ordered partitioning.  It's
		easier to find customer Blogs' file amongst the 30 or so files in his
		home branch, rather than in amongst the thousands of files in the
		organisation as a whole, as with the flat file system model. To this
		day, the hierarchical model is helping people store, organise, and lose
		their data, in the familiar form of your operating system file system
		structure.</p>

		<p>Although the hierarchical model provides much greater flexibility
		than flat models, it is limited in the nature of the relationships it
		can model. It is supremely capable of representing hierarchical
		relationships (hence the name), as in parent/child,
		container/contained, or category/object relationships. Such
		relationships are often called 'one-to-many' relationships, there being
		one record to which many others are subordinate. Hierarchical models
		cannot represent (without some form of link or pointer extensions)
		multiple inheritance, or so-called 'many-to-many' relationships.
		Consider the case of a child; All children have two parents, and may
		have an arbitrary number of children themselves. In a hierarchical
		model, the child record cannot be in both the mother's collection of
		children and the father's collection of children, unless it exists
		twice as record.  If we allow records to have multiple instances, we
		vastly increase the complexity of the database logic. Which record is
		the actual record? I must search for and update/modify duplicates when
		changes are made. If I ask for a summation from many records, do I
		count duplicates only once, and if so how do I detect them as
		duplicates? It was these inadequacies that gave rise to the relational
		database model.</p>
