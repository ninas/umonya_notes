		<h2>The while Statement</h2>

		<p>The last program we wrote, to count the number of even and negative
		numbers entered by the user, was already getting pretty large if one
		measures program size in lines of code. And it only handled three
		inputs! What if we wanted a hundred inputs.  Cutting and pasting would
		work, but making those small changes to each section of code dealing
		with a specific number would be tedious at best, and error prone at
		worst. Fortunately, computers excel at repetitive tasks.
    Enter the while statement:</p>

		<p>The while statement executes a statement, or block of statements,
		repeatedly, as long as a given expression is True. So let's rethink our
		previous problem. Previously, we would have described the problem as:</p>

		<blockquote class='problem'>

			The user enters three integers. The program outputs how many of
			those integers were even, and how many were both even and negative.
			Also, if the number entered is even, a message stating the number
			entered is even is printed. Similarly a message is printed if the
			number is both even and negative, indicating the number is
			negative.

		</blockquote>

		<p>But we are not happy with just three numbers, so let's re-describe
		the behaviour we want from our program</p>

		<blockquote class='problem'>

			The user may <strong>enter</strong> a number.
			<strong>Until</strong> the user enters a blank line, the program
			continues accepting numbers. After a blank line has been entered
			the program <strong>outputs</strong> the number of numbers entered
			by the user <strong>which</strong> were even, as well as the number
			of numbers <strong>which</strong> were <span
			class='group'><strong>both</strong> even <strong>and</strong>
			negative</span>.

		</blockquote>

		<p>Much like how in junior school we were taught to look for key words
		in word problems to help us formulate the problem mathematically, we
		can and should do the same with descriptions of problems and their
		translation into program code. Everything in programming comes down to
		one of three 'structures'...</p>

		<ul>

			<li>A sequence of steps</li>

			<li>A condition that selects which sequence of steps to
			execute</li>

			<li>A repetition of a sequence of steps</li>

		</ul>

		<p>In the problem description above, we can identify some key words
		already hint at the structures we should use.</p>

		<dl>

			<dt>enter</dt>

			<dd>Relates to input -- input()</dd>

			<dt>until</dt>

			<dd>Indicates <strong>repetition</strong> based on the fulfillment
			of a <strong>condition</strong> -- while statement</dd>

			<dt>output</dt>

			<dd>Indicates <strong>output</strong> -- print statement</dd>

			<dt>which</dt>

			<dd>Indicates a <strong>condition without repetition</strong> -- if
			statement</dd>

			<dt>both ... and ...</dt>

			<dd>Indicates a <strong>composition of conditions</strong> -- and
			operator</dd>

		</dl>

		<p>We'll now step through the problem description, sentence by sentence
		and convert it into a python program, using the keywords as hints, and
		the tools we have already come across. Also we'll introduce the syntax
		of the while statement.</p>

		<blockquote class='problem'>
			The user may enter a number.
		</blockquote>

		<p>Looking at the keywords and their hints, we want to use the
		input function here. This is true of any input from the keyboard generally.
		Thus, our first line of code will be</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
number = input("Enter a number: ")
</pre>

		<blockquote class='problem'>
			Until the user enters a blank line, the program continues accepting numbers.
		</blockquote>

		<p>Okay, from the hints we see we should be using a while statement,
		but <strong>beware</strong>! We don't have an 'until statement' in
		python, and in English until and while are opposites, so we just need
		to transform the problem slightly so that we now have</p>

		<blockquote class='problem'>

			<strong>While</strong> the user enters a line <strong>that is not
			blank</strong>, the program continues accepting numbers.

		</blockquote>

		<p>This translates directly into python code which we append to what
		we've already got to produce</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
number = input("Enter a number: ")
while number != '':
    number = input("Enter another number (or nothing to finish): ")
</pre>

		<p>Note the prompt has changed to tell the user what to do to exit the
		program, namely enter a blank line rather than a number. Also note the
		format, or syntax, of the while statement.</p>

		<pre class='definition'>
while &lt;expression&gt;:
    statement
    statement
    ...
</pre>

		<p>See how we indent statements we want executed repetitively and
		conditionally under the while statement, in the same way as we do with
		if statements. The while statement checks the expression, and if it is
		True, will execute those indented statements once, after which it will
		check the expression again, and execute the statements etc ... If the
		expression is ever False, execution of the program continues at the
		first un-indented statement after the indented block.</p>

		<p>There's a little more to the while loop that pure syntax. Every
		loop needs three things; A start point, an end point, and a way to get
		from one point to another. More importantly there needs to be a
		relationship between these three things, in the form of a variable. The
		start point takes the form of assigning a value (the starting value) to
		a variable, which we'll call the counter. The while loop's condition
		specifies the stop point of the loop, by specifying a condition under
		which the loop should terminate <strong>in terms of the counter
		variable</strong>. Finally, the loop needs a way to get from start to
		finish in a stepwise manner, i.e. a way to take a single step. This
		means the value of the counter variable must change
		<strong>inside</strong> the repeated block of statements, otherwise
		value of the loop condition won't change, and the loop will repeat
		forever. Commonly, the statement that changes the counter's
		value is placed at the <em>end</em> of the repeated block of
		statements, because this means it is changed immediately before the
		counter variable is checked in the loop condition again. This gives us
		the pattern:</p>

		<pre class='definition'>
counter = &lt;start_value&gt; #Initialise the counter
while &lt;expression&gt;: #&lt;expression&gt; specifies when the loop will stop in terms of counter
    statement
    statement
    ...
    counter = &lt;new value of counter&gt; #changes the value of counter
</pre>

		<blockquote class='problem'>

			After a blank line has been entered the program outputs the total amount
			of numbers entered by the user which were even.

		</blockquote>

		<p>Now we haven't kept a record of the numbers entered so how can we
		tell how many were even? The solution is to keep a count as even
		numbers are entered. How do we store a value?
		<strong>Variables</strong>! We need to know <strong>how many</strong>
		numbers were even, indicating quantity, indicating a number, i.e. an
		integer. So let's create a new integer to use whilst counting, and call
		it 'even'. But to create a new variable we have to give it a value!
		What value can we give even, if we don't know how many even numbers the
		user will enter? Well we do know how many even numbers there are before
		the user has entered any numbers; there are 0 even numbers. So let's
		put an assignment statement to that effect into our program in the
		right place (before a number is entered).</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
even = 0
number = input("Enter a number: ")
while number != '':
    number = input("Enter another number (or nothing to finish): ")
</pre>

		<p>Now at the end of our program we still have 0 even numbers, because
		we haven't changed the value of 'even'. We wish to count how many
		numbers that are entered are even, which means we need to increment
		(increase by one) every time an even number is entered. Firstly, how do
		we distinguish even numbers from odd? We use an if statement, because
		this is a condition. Secondly, where to we actually place the counting
		statements. Here's a suggestion:</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
even = 0
number = input("Enter a number: ")
while number != '':
    if int(number) % 2 == 0: #if number is even
        even = even + 1
    number = input("Enter another number (or nothing to finish): ")
</pre>

		<p>A few things about our two new lines deserve mention. Firstly, as we
		are already familiar with, input() returns a string, so we need to
		type cast to an integer before we can test whether it is even. Then
		there's the condition itself. The definition of an even number is a
		number divisible exactly by 2, i.e. without remainder. The '%' operator
		returns the remainder of a division, and is thus perfectly suited to
		the job of testing whether a number is even or odd. If the remainder of
		the division is 0, the number is even. Also we have nested the if
		statement within the while statement, so it may be executed multiple
		times, one each time a number is entered, to test the number. We have
		put it <strong>before</strong> the input function within the while
		statement because we don't want to test an empty string (blank line)
		for evenness in the case where the user has not entered a number and
		wishes to finish up. This way the while statement's expression tests
		whether the input is a blank line, before we convert to an integer and
		test for evenness.</p>

		<blockquote class='problem'>
			as well as the number of numbers which were both even and negative.
		</blockquote>

		<p>The last piece of the problem description says we should also count
		how many of the input numbers are negative as well as even. And we need
		to put some output at the end once we've counted everything. Well, this
		is very similar to the previous segment, so let's recycle the idea and
		see what we get...</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
even = 0
negative = 0
number = input("Enter a number: ")
while number != '':
    if int(number) % 2 == 0: #if number is even
        even = even + 1
        if int(number) &lt; 0:
            negative = negative + 1
    number = input("Enter another number (or nothing to finish): ")
print("There were", even, "even numbers, of which", negative, "were also negative")
</pre>

		<p>So we've included a new variable, 'negative', which counts the
		number of negative entries, but only if those entries are even. Why is
		this? We haven't specified (<code>int(number) % 2 == 0 and int(number)
		&lt; 0</code>). Instead we have nested the test for negativity inside
		the test for evenness. This means a number will only be tested, and
		thus potentially counted, for negativity if it has already been found
		to be even.</p>

		<h2>The break Statement</h2>

		<p>Looking at the while statement, it seems that once we're in a block
		of statements to be executed repeatedly, known as a
		<strong>loop</strong>, we can't get out of the loop except when the
		expression after 'while' (or <strong>loop condition</strong>) is False.
		Python provides us with a statement for breaking out of a loop,
		conveniently called break. Suppose we
		wanted our program for counting even numbers to end not only when a
		blank line was entered, but also if the user enters the string 'quit'.
		We could simply add two lines ...</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
even = 0
negative = 0
number = input("Enter a number (or nothing or 'quit' to quit): ")
while number != '':
    if number == 'quit':
        break
    if int(number) % 2 == 0: #if number is even
        even = even + 1
        if int(number) &lt; 0:
            negative = negative + 1
    number = input("Enter another number (or nothing to finish): ")
print("There were", even, "even numbers, of which", negative, "were also negative")
</pre>

		<p>Again we check what the user has entered, and if it is the string
		'quit', we <strong>break</strong> out of the loop, meaning execution
		continues at the print statement.</p>

		<h2>The continue Statement</h2>

		<p>If we wanted to get picky and consider 0 to not be even, we would
		have to modify our code so that it doesn't count a '0' entry as even or
		negative. We can't simply break out of the loop, because the user may
		want to enter more numbers after the '0'. We could enclose the entire
		test for evenness in an if statement that makes sure the number entered
		is not 0, but python provides us with a more elegant solution, the continue statement.
		The continue statement jumps the flow of execution immediately back to
		the loop condition, at which point normal loop execution flow
		resumes.</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
even = 0
negative = 0
number = input("Enter a number (or nothing or 'quit' to quit): ")
while number != '':
    if number == 'quit':
        break
    if number == '0':
        number = input("Enter another number (or nothing or 'quit' to quit): ")
        continue
    if int(number) % 2 == 0: #if number is even
        even = even + 1
        if int(number) &lt; 0:
            negative = negative + 1
    number = input("Enter another number (or nothing or 'quit' to quit): ")
print("There were", even, "even numbers, of which", negative, "were also negative")
</pre>

		<h2>else Clauses in while loops</h2>

		<p>'while loop' statements may also have an else clause, which is
		executed when the loop terminates when the condition becomes False, but
		not when the loop is terminated by a break statement.

		<pre class='definition'>
while &lt;expression&gt;:
    &lt;statement&gt;
    [statement]
else:
    &lt;statement&gt;
    [statement]
</pre>

		<h2>Exercises</h2>

		<p>Given the code ...</p>

<pre class='listing'>
i = 1
while i < 32:
    if 32%i == 0:
        print(i, "is a factor of 32")
    else:
        print(i, "is not a factor of 32")
</pre>
