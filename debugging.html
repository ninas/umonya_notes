		<h2>The Universal Method (a.k.a. The Quick and Dirty Method)</h2>

		<p>Tracking down bugs in our programs is a difficult and labour
		intensive task. Doing so requires knowledge of the execution flow up to
		the point of the bug, and the values of a number of variables that may
		have either influenced the flow of execution (e.g. the variable's value
		is tested in and 'if statement'), or be involved directly in producing
		the bug (e.g. an expression on the line causing the error refers to the
		variable directly). We've already learnt about the call stack and the
		traceback, which helps us when a fatal error occurs, but we often find
		our programs not causing errors, but doing the wrong thing nonetheless.
		Such logical errors, on our parts as programmers, still constitute bugs
		in the program, and must be ruthlessly exterminated!</p>

		<p>But without a traceback, how can we determine the flow of execution?
		Well, we could put a whole lot of print statements into or code along
		the lines of "Reached point xyz". Similarly, we can print the value of
		relevant variables out whenever we need to. This method of debugging is
		surprisingly effective, and more importantly, works universally. It
		works in any programming language, in any editor, with any version of
		python ... anywhere.</p>

		<h2>The Universal Quick and Slightly Cleaner Method</h2>

		<p>Obviously, once we've found the bug, we would want to remove all
		those print statements, so that our eventual user doesn't see all that
		'debugging junk'. Which means we have to trawl through all our code
		removing debug lines, and putting them all back again for the next bug.
		We could of course just comment the print statements out. But there are
		better ways of doing it, although they require more work on our part
		initially, the pay-off in the long is generally worth it.</p>

		<p>The <a class="doclink"
		href="http://docs.python.org/ref/assert.html">assert statement</a> is a
		statement in python that checks whether a condition is True or not. If
		the condition is False, then an error is forced immediately. The
		benefit of the assert statement is that we can tell python to ignore
		them for when the user runs our program, by requesting that python run
		in optimised mode using the '-O' argument. We use the assert statement
		as follows</p>

		<pre class='definition'>
assert &lt;expression&gt;
</pre>

		<p>When python runs your script in non-optimised mode, and the assert
		statement is encountered, the expression is evaluated. If it evaluates
		to anything other than True, an AssertionError is caused.</p>

		<p>The drawback of assertions is that if the user is left to run our
		script, and forgets to run it with <code>python -O</code>, the
		assertions are not ignored. So how about making our own version of
		assertions, in such a way, that they can be turned on and off at one
		place in the code, and even better, dump output to a file, instead of
		the screen. That way, a user could even run our program with debugging
		statements still active, and not have debug output interfere with their
		normal running of the program. If an error does occur, they could email
		us the debug log, which gives us a complete record of how the program
		arrived at the error state.</p>

		<p>We start with a function. And the function shall be called
		'debuglog'. In debug log, we want to open the debug log file, append
		the chosen debug message to the file, and close it again, so that it's
		contents are flushed to disk, in case an error occurs before flushing.
		In addition, it must only do all this if a global variable
		'debug_logging' is set to True.</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
debug_logging = True

def debug_log(expr):
    if debug_logging:
        f = open(".debug_log","a")
        f.write("%r\n"%expr)
        f.close()
</pre>

		<p>With these five simple lines of code, we can now go absolutely ape
		with debug_log calls all over our code. And all we ever have to do,
		when we don't want debugging any more, is to change the first line to
		<code>debug_logging = False</code>. This method of debugging will also
		work in any programming language, on any OS, in any editor, etc...</p>

		<h2>Using PDB -- The Python Debugger</h2>

		<p>There will be times when the universal methods just aren't
		sufficient, or are simply to cumbersome to use. For example, the debug
		log produced might be thousands of lines long, in which case, tracking
		through it would be tedious and not generally worthwhile. It is for
		this purpose that so called 'debuggers' were built. Python's debugger
		is called <a class="doclink"
		href='http://docs.python.org/lib/module-pdb.html'>pdb</a>, and is
		invoked by running python with the '-m pdb' option.</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
sirlark@hephaestus ~ $ python -m pdb myprog.py
</pre>

		<p>A complete run down of pdb and its abilities would go on for pages,
		and would be more completely described in the python documentation
		anyway. Instead, we will just explore the very basics of using a
		debugger. When pdb is started, we are presented with</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
sirlark@hephaestus ~/scratch $ python -m pdb hannoi.py 
&gt; /home/sirlark/scratch/hannoi.py(2)?()
-&gt; import sys
(Pdb) 
</pre>

		<p>What a debugger does is allow us to 'step' through our program one
		line at a time. After each line, our program is paused, and the
		debugger gives us the ability to examine the state of the program.
		After each line of code executed, we are told two things, the current
		location in our program as far as execution is concerned, which is the
		line starting with '&gt;'. This line tells us the file and line number
		of execution. The line starting with '-&gt;' displays the contents of
		the line <strong>that will be executed next</strong>. Finally we are
		prompted to enter a command. The commands we are most interested in
		are</p>

		<ul>

			<li><code>step</code>: steps into the next line, i.e. if there are
			any function calls on the line, we will dive into those functions,
			and process them line by line.</li>

			<li><code>next</code>: steps over the next line, i.e. functions on
			the line are called, but we do not process them step by step.</li>

			<li><code>list</code>: prints out some context code, from five
			lines before the next line to be executed, to five lines after that
			line. We are thus able to get a better idea of where in our code we
			are currently.</li>

			<li><code>break [file:]&lt;lineno&gt; [, condition]</code>: sets a
			breakpoint at specified line in file (or the current file if file
			is not specified). A break point means that program execution
			<strong>will</strong> pause when this line is reached, even if we
			are not stepping through our code at the time. If a condition is
			specified, e.g. x == 7, then execution will only pause if that
			condition is True when the line is reached. Conditions are normal
			python expressions that we might use in our code directly, and have
			access to all the variables in our program using the same scope
			rules. If no line number is specified, then a list of all currently
			set breakpoints and their numbers is printed out.</li>

			<li><code>clear &lt;bp-number&gt;</code>: unsets the breakpoint
			numbered 'bp-number'. To see a breakpoint's number, type
			<code>break</code> without any arguments.</li>

			<li><code>continue</code>: continues execution normally, preventing
			pausing at the next line. The program will continue execution until
			a break point is reached, an error occurs, or the program
			terminates normally.</li>

			<li><code>quit</code>: Obvious, but important to know!</li>

		</ul>

		<p>In addition, pdb returns the value of any python expression we care
		to enter into its command line, within the context of the program being
		debugged. So, if our program had a variable 'x', we could determine
		'x's value at a the current point of execution by simply entering 'x'
		and pdb's prompt. This provides with all we need to literally see how
		our program executes, line by line, and what the state of any
		particular variable is at any given point in program execution.</p>

		<h2>The Ideal Solution -- Using an Integrated Debugger</h2>

		<p>The python debugger (pdb) is nice, but as debuggers go it is pretty
		clunky. It was put into python as an afterthought, and it shows. The
		interface leaves a lot to be desired, but more importantly, it leaves
		out some fairly important tools such as being able to split the output
		of the debugger from that of our program.</p>

		<p>The ideal solution, although a completely non-standard, non-portable
		one, is to use an integrated debugger. By this we mean a debugger that
		runs within the editor of your choice. Not all editors have this
		functionality, and of those that do, not all implement it in the same
		way. The keys used to perform different debugging tasks are generally
		totally different from one editor to another. That having been said, if
		you use such an editor, its integrated debugger is the easiest and most
		powerful way to debug your program! The best thing about an integrated
		debugger is the visual feedback you receive. Being able to see the
		execution line move as you step to the next line of code, and monitor
		the values of chosen variables or expressions as execution progresses
		is an invaluable tool. Debugging terminology is thankfully pretty
		standard, so search your editors menus and documentation for mention
		of</p>

		<ul>

			<li><strong>step into:</strong> equivalent to step in pdb</li>

			<li><strong>step over:</strong> equivalent to next in pdb</li>

			<li><strong>add watch:</strong> add a new expression to the list of
			expressions to monitor</li>

			<li><strong>continue:</strong> equivalent to continue in pdb</li>

			<li><strong>set/toggle breakpoint:</strong> equivalent to break or
			clear in pdb, applied to the line the cursor is currently on</li>

		</ul>
