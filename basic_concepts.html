		<h2>What is a Program?</h2>

		<p>Simply put, a program is a set of instructions on <strong>how</strong> to 
		take some <strong>input</strong> data and produce 
		<strong>output</strong> data. Programs can be written in many
		languages, such as PERL, Python, C, Ruby, Pascal, etc... Even a
		stylised form of natural languages such as English, known as pseudo
		code, can be used to describe a program effectively.</p>

		<div class="centered">
			<strong>Input -&gt; Program -&gt; Output</strong>
		</div>

		<p>It is important to realise that the <strong>program</strong>
		determines what input is satisfactory, and what input will cause error.
		Input cannot be used to change how a program works. Similarly, the program
		defines what output will be produced. If you need a program to handle
		input differently, you need to write a new program. Likewise, if the
		output isn't what you need, you will need to change the program too.</p>

		<p>Ultimately a program, no matter what language it is written in,
		consists of a some atomic actions/instructions, each one an instruction
		that cannot be divided into a sequence of 'smaller' or 'less complex'
		instructions. These instructions are composed (as in mathematical
		composition) in various manners, usually by issuing them in sequential order,
		but also by defining the result of one instruction as the operand of
		another.</p>

		<p>Instructions (or sets of composed instructions) can be divided into
		two groups, those that produce a result, and those that
		don't. For example, adding two numbers, 3 and 4, together has a result
		(7). More specifically, it has a <strong>value</strong>, i.e. some data
		the program can continue to work with. Contrast this with an
		instruction that puts a line of text on the screen. It produces no
		value as a result. Instructions which produce a value are called
		<strong>expressions</strong>, instructions which produce no value are
		called <strong>statements</strong></p>

		<p>In a similar manner to statements, expressions can be combined with
		other expressions, to form complex expressions. Expressions are
		combined using <strong>operators</strong> such as the mathematical
		functions sum, difference, product, quotient, etc... Thus 1+1 is also
		an expression that has <strong>a single value</strong> despite the fact
		that it is a composite of multiple sub-expressions.</p>

		<p>Which we can compare to the much simpler version of the same thing
		in python</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
a = 12
b = 12
if a*b == 144:
    a = 1
</pre>

		<p>The basic point is to illustrate that programs are made up of small,
		well defined, <strong>easy to understand</strong> steps in sequence. As
		in chess, where each individual piece can only move in a very limited
		number of ways, yielding a tiny number of potential moves per piece per
		turn, these moves can be combined in a near infinite number of ways and
		often grouped together into common techniques or strategies. So too can
		the simple statements of a programming language be combined in infinite
		ways to produce complex but meaningful results.</p>

		<h2>Everyone can program!</h2>
		
		<p>Believe it or not, you've programmed before. You've programmed your
		friends, and do so every time you give them directions.  After all what
		is a set of directions but a sequence of instructions.</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
OUT OF Cape Town TAKE the N1
TAKE the Sable rd. Offramp
AT the fork VEER LEFT
AT the traffic lights TURN LEFT
AT the NEXT traffic lights TURN RIGHT 
AT the traffic circle TURN LEFT
AT the NEXT traffic circle TURN RIGHT 
AT the t-junction TURN LEFT
</pre>

		<p>You will note that some (in fact a hell of a lot) of the words in
		the directions to my place are capitalised. In the language of giving
		directions, these are pretty much our atomic instructions. The portion
		of the directions left in lower case are labels or names for things that
		are not common to all sets of directions, most often places specific to
		the set of directions being given. These have value, and would be our
		expressions.</p>
		
		<p>Examining the directions we have</p>

		<dl>
			<dt>OUT OF</dt>

			<dd>meaning I must first be <strong>in</strong> a named place
			before performing the next instruction</dd>

			<dt>TAKE</dt>

			<dd>meaning to drive along, or turn off onto a named offramp</dd>

			<dt>AT</dt>

			<dd>continue until the named place or situation is reached
			<strong>before</strong> performing the next instruction</dd>

			<dt>VEER</dt>

			<dd>meaning to stay in a particular lane as the road splits</dd>

			<dt>TURN LEFT, TURN RIGHT</dt>

			<dd>self explanatory</dd>

			<dt>NEXT</dt>

			<dd>meaning the next object of specified type encountered</dd>
		</dl>

		<p>At first the description of these concepts may seem obvious, but
		recall that computers, the machines executing your programming
		instructions, have an IQ of 0. They are not intelligent, fiendishly
		annoying at times perhaps, but never intelligent, never aware, never
		capable of the massive amounts of inference and contextualization done
		by the human brain. They are designed and built to understand and
		execute only specific atomic steps. So what is implicit in the
		instructions contained in a set of directions given to us, must be
		explicitly defined for a computer.</p>

		<h2>Data representation and translation of real world problems</h2>

		<p>Now that the concept of sequences of statements has been thoroughly
		flogged to death, to what do these statements apply? They apply to
		<strong>data</strong>! But data in a computer, like instructions, must
		be simple and well defined, or at the very least able to be broken down
		into multiple well defined simple pieces. In general computers work
		only with numbers. The pictures you see on screen, the text you are
		reading, the sound you hear when playing MP3s are all numbers. The
		actual physical devices attached to the computer are what are
		responsible for transforming the numbers with which the CPU deals into
		humanly recognisable phenomena such as sound waves and images. Until
		the screen, or the speakers, are reached, everything is numbers.  So it
		stands to reason that the most basic, atomic, unit of data in a
		computer is a number. Fortunately, modern programming languages are
		capable of dealing with numbers and sequences of numbers in a few
		different ways. Integers and Reals can be considered atomic data units
		in almost every modern computer language, as can text in the form of a
		string of characters in sequence.</p>

		<p>As programs are usually written to solve problems occurring in the
		real world, it falls to the programmer to translate the problem being
		solved into something the computer can deal with, i.e. numbers. This is
		reminiscent of those annoying word problems we encountered in junior
		school mathematics.</p>

		<blockquote class='problem'>

			Jane has seven apples, Mary has four, Bob has one. They pool their
			resources, and divide the apples equally. How many apples does each
			one receive?

		</blockquote>

		<p>The most difficult concept to grasp when learning to program is the
		ability to translate a problem expressed in words into a set of
		instructions that describe the solution to the problem. Learning a
		programming language doesn't teach one to program, it merely provides
		one with a specific set of tools with which one can solve a problem.
		Learning how to apply these tools is the true skill to programming, and
		this comes primarily with experience. The problem set out above is
		ridiculously simple, and you've already worked out the answer in your
		head, but <strong>how did you do it?</strong> Describe the process! But
		what if there were 1000 people involved, and many thousands of apples.
		Working it out in your head becomes a tedious task, but the basic
		process you followed in your head for three people applies equally well
		to the case of a thousand people. And so for our first exercise in
		programming let us translate the word problem into the atomic
		statements and atomic data units that can be used to provide us with
		the answer. Assume we are provided with only the following statements
		and expressions to work with, and that statements are numbered from 1
		upwards in the order in which they appear in our program:</p>

		<ul>

			<li>EXPRESSION -- raw_input(): get a number from input</li>

			<li>STATEMENT -- labelname = #: Assign the value of number to
			a label for storage</li>

			<li>STATEMENT -- labelname += #: Addition of the second number
			to the number stored in labelname</li>

			<li>STATEMENT -- if # != # {}: check if the two numbers
			are not equal. If they are not equal perform any instructions
			within the braces {}</li>

			<li>STATEMENT -- GOTO #: Instead of executing the next
			statement, execute the statement numbered '#'</li>

			<li>STATEMENT -- labelname /= #: Division of the number stored
			in labelname by '#'</li>

			<li>STATEMENT -- print #: Output of a number to the
			screen</li>
		
		</ul>

		<p>Note that "#" can be either an actual number, the name of a
		label storing a number, or the instruction "raw_input()" which is the
		number received as input.</p>

		<blockquote class='problem'>

			Each of a number of people has at least one apple. They pool their
			resources and divide the apples equally. For any given number of
			people and the number of apples each of these people has, how many
			apples will each person receive?

		</blockquote>

		<p>Given only the above statements and expressions to work with, there
		are some important questions that need answering</p>

		<ul>

			<li>Do we need to know who started with how many apples?</li>

			<li>How do we represent how many apples there are?</li>

			<li>How can one determine the total number of people?</li>

		</ul>

<pre class='listing'>
 1: apples = 0
 2: people = 0
 3: a = raw_input()
 4: people += 1
 5: if a != 0 {
 6:     apples += a
 7:     GOTO 3
    }
 8: apples /= people
 9: print apples
</pre>
