		<h2>Abstracting Common Tasks with Functions</h2>

		<p>So now we've been programming nearly two days, you've just started to come
		across a number of tedious tasks that we must 'program repeatedly', as
		opposed to 'program to repeat'; e.g. looping until a blank line is
		entered. Often these common tasks are similar, but not exactly the
		same, e.g. different things need to be done in the loop until a blank
		line is reached. Ideally we want a labour saving device, and thus we
		turn to the <a class="doclink" href=
		'http://olympiad.cs.uct.ac.za/docs/python-docs-2.6/reference/compound_stmts.html#function'>function</a>. We have
		already been introduced to the use of functions by calling various
		built in functions, but ultimately we want to be able to make our own
		functions.</p>

		<h2>Defining New Functions</h2>

		<p>We define a new function using the <strong>def statement</strong>,
		which takes the form</p>

		<pre class='definition'>
def &lt;funcname&gt;([parameter name][, parameter name][, ...]):
    statement
    [statement]
    [...]
</pre>

		<p>When this 'def' statement is executed, a new object with the name
		'funcname' is created. Whenever this object is used followed by pair of
		round braces, the statements listed in the 'def' statement, commonly
		called the <strong>function definition</strong>, are executed, and once
		completed, execution continues from where it was before the function
		statements were entered. This process is known as <strong>calling a
		function</strong>.</p>

		<p>It is important to understand that functions provide us with a
		radically different way to influence the sequence or flow in which our
		programs execute. Conditions and loops still progress in a roughly top
		to bottom fashion, but functions allow us to 'dive into' a small block
		of statements, and come back up to where we were just prior to our
		dive, more of an in and out form of control.</p>

		<p>Of great use is that functions can return a value. In fact in
		python, all functions return a value, even if not given a value to
		return (in which case the return value is None). This is done by the
		use of the <strong>return statement</strong>. The return statement,
		when used within a function definition, simply causes that function to
		return the value of the expression immediately following the 'return'.
		Formally, return statements take the form</p>

		<pre class='definition'>
    return &lt;expression&gt;
</pre>

		<p>As an example, here is the definition of a simple function to print
		a triangle of height 3.</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
def triangle3():
    print "*"
    print "**"
    print "***"
</pre>

		<p>Henceforth, whenever python encounters <code>triangle3()</code> the
		three print statements will be executed. Note the brackets! They
		indicate triangle3 should be called, rather than treated as a variable.
		Looking at triangle three, there's nothing we couldn't do without cut
		and paste, so why bother? Well recall that way back in the Basic Input
		section we said that functions are like mini-programs, in that they
		take input and produce output. Well that would mean a function would
		produce different output depending on its input, but how do we give a
		function input?</p>

		<h2>Passing and Receiving Parameters by Position</h2>

		<p>Functions receive their input from parameters, which are values
		given in a comma separated list (i.e. a tuple) when calling the
		function, and are unpacked within the function automatically. We have
		to define how many parameters a function takes, and what each ones
		names would be, so we can give a function appropriate parameters later
		on. For example let's define a function that accepts one parameter,
		called 'seconds' and returns how many complete minutes are in that many
		seconds, and then call it...</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
Python 2.6.4 (r264:75706, Dec 7 2009, 18:43:55) [MSC v.1310 32 bit (Intel)] on win32 
[GCC 3.4.6 (Gentoo 3.4.6-r1, ssp-3.4.5-1.0, pie-8.7.9)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; def minutes(seconds):
...    print seconds
...    return seconds/60
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; minutes
&lt;function minutes at 0xb7cfcdbc&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; minutes(71)
71
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; minutes(71.0)
71.0
1.1833333333333333
&gt;&gt;&gt; minutes("bob")
bob
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in ?
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 2, in minutes
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'int'
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

		<p>In the above example we can already see a number of things about
		functions and how they handle parameters. Firstly, the 'def statement'
		is executed and 'minutes' is created as a function 'object', as
		evidenced by the value returned after typing in 'minutes'. Note however
		when we call it by typing 'minutes(71)', instead python actually
		executes the statements in the definition of the function 'minutes'.
		The first statement in the definition prints out the value of seconds
		as 71. But where did the value 71 come from?</p>

		<p>Well, thinking back to tuples, let's treat everything between the
		open and close brackets in a function call as if it were forming a
		tuple, so in the case of the function call <code>minutes(71)</code> we
		have formed a tuple '(71, )'. Before the first statement of the
		function definition is executed, the tuple created by calling the
		function is unpacked using the names in the function definition's
		parameter list <strong>in order</strong>. In our case this creates an
		implicit line before <code>print seconds</code> which looks like</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
		seconds, = 71,
</pre>

		<p>Note in the example transcript how the type of the parameter
		'seconds' changes according to the type of the value used in the
		function. In fact in the third function call made, the type used
		actually causes an error, which makes sense since we cannot divide a
		string by an integer (60). In the error case, we see that the first
		statement in the function definition (<code>print seconds</code>) is
		executed without error, and that the error occurs later, meaning we are
		able to differentiate where within a particular function execution
		flows, and the functions are not treated as atomic.</p>

		<p>The concepts of parameter passing are best illustrated in the case
		of multiple parameters. For example, if we define a function which
		takes two parameters, prints out both (solely for the purpose of
		example), and returns the smaller of the two parameters ...</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; def minimum(a, b):
...    print a
...    print b
...    if a &lt; b:
...        return a
...    else:
...        return b
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; minimum(9, 3)
9
3
3
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

		<p>Okay, we're taking a few extra baby steps here... let's look at what
		we've done. We've defined a new function called 'minimum', it has two
		parameters, 'a' and 'b'. By virtue of putting <code>a, b</code> in the
		parameter list in the function definition, we are implicitly putting
		the line <code>a, b = &lt;passed in tuple&gt;</code> in as the first
		line, where the passed in tuple is formed by the function call itself,
		rather than the function definition. Next we notice that we can branch
		execution flow using an 'if statement' within a function definition. We
		can also loop, in fact we can do pretty much anything we want within a
		function definition. Finally let's focus on the 'return statement'.
		Each return statement exits the function immediately, and replaces the
		value of the function call with the value of the expression following
		the reserved word 'return'. So following <code>minimum(9,3)</code> we
		see that program execution 'dives into' the function 'minimum', sets
		'a' and 'b' to 9 and 3 respectively via the implicit tuple unpacking,
		prints 'a', prints 'b', and never executes <code>return a</code> but
		instead executes <code>return b</code>, at which point execution leaves
		the function definition, and returns (hence the name return) to the
		point of the function call, and making the value of the function call
		<em>3</em>.</p>

		<h2>Composition of Functions in the Definition</h2>

		<p>Of course, since we can do 'pretty much anything' in a function
		definition, we can also call other functions, both python built in
		functions, and our own defined ones, as in an example to get two
		coordinates from the user.</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
def getcoords():
    x = input("Enter an X coordinate: ")
    y = input("Enter a Y coordinate: ")
    print "The smaller coordinate is %i" % ( minimum(int(x), int(y)) )
    return x, y
</pre>

		<p>So here we have called both a built in function (input) and our
		own previously defined function (minimum) within the function
		definition. Also note that we form a tuple in our return statement. We
		wish to return two values, but the 'return statement' can only return
		the value of a singe expression, so to return multiple values, that
		expression must be a tuple (or list) of values.</p>

		<h2>Composition of Functions in Parameter Lists</h2>

		<p>Just as expressions can be composed to form more complex expression,
		so can functions be composed in the strict mathematical sense, i.e.
		given two functions 'f(a)' and 'g(b)', we can obtain a value for f of g
		of x. Similarly in python we could say,</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
print minimum(5, minimum(int(input("&gt; ")), 8))
</pre>

		<p>Remember that expressions are evaluated inside to outside, so the
		value of input is determined first, then it is converted to an
		integer, then compared against 8 in the inner minimum function, and
		finally the value of the inner minimum function is compared against 5
		in the outer minimum function. Thus we have composed minimum with
		itself, and further with input.</p>

		<p>In the same way that the range of 'g(b)' must fall within the domain
		of 'f(a)', so too must we ensure in python when doing our function
		compositions that the results of inner functions are of appropriate
		type and value for use as parameters to outer functions.</p>

		<!--<h2>Providing Default Values for Parameters</h2>

		<p>Considering programming is all about being lazy and getting
		computers to do the work for us, we find that entering every single
		parameter every time we call a function gets tedious. Especially if 90%
		of the time we are entering the same values. We want to be able to
		specify a default value to assume when we feel lazy and want to leave
		those parameters out. We do this by 'assigning' a default value when
		specifying the parameter list in the function definition.</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
#a simple function to change the radix (base) of a number, and return a string
#representing the number in the chosen radix
#this is most commonly used for hexadecimal notation, hence the default of 16

def radix(number, r = 16, case = "upper"):
    upper = "0123456789ABCDEF"
    lower = "0123456789abcdef"
    if case == "upper":
        digits = upper
    else:
        digits = lower
    ret = ""
    while number &gt; 0:
        ret = digits[number % r] + ret
        number /= r
    return ret

print radix(17)
print radix(255)
print radix(17,8)
print radix(17,2)
</pre>

		<p>The example above produces the following output</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
11
FF
21
10001
</pre>

		<p>Deconstruction time! Note first how we define the parameter list of
		the 'radix' function. We assign defaults. When we call 'radix' the
		first time, we only provide one parameter, so during the implicit tuple
		unpacking, we get the equivalent of <code>number, r, case = 17,</code>
		which would be problematic because the right hand tuple is not big
		enough. In this case python fills up the tuple as necessary with the
		default values, yielding in fact <code>number, r, case = 17, 16,
		"upper"</code>.</p>

		<p>Looking at our third call of the 'radix' function, we have provided
		two parameters, so python unpacks the tuple as <code>number, r, case =
		17, 8,</code>, and fills up to the size required with default values,
		so we get<br /> <code>number, r, case = 17, 8, "upper"</code>. Note how
		the default values <strong>fill up their respective positions in the
		tuple</strong>, and not from left to right, i.e. the first missing
		parameter ('case') is filled up not with the first default parameter
		(16), but rather the default for the parameter at the missing position
		('upper'). Because passed in values are not associated by name to the
		parameter names in the function definition, but rather by position, it
		is imperative that we specify default values (thus allowing optional
		parameters) <strong>after all mandatory parameters</strong>. Finally,
		and obviously, if all the parameters are provided, no defaults are
		used.</p>

		<h2>Handling Keyword Arguments for Parameters</h2>

		<p>There is one more way in which parameters can be passed. That being
		by keyword. Python uses a very specific format for specifying the
		passing of parameters by keyword,</p>

		<pre class='definition'>
def &lt;funcname&gt;([parameter 1][, parameter 2][...][[,] **kwargs]):
    statement
    [statement]
    [...]
</pre>

		<p>Ending a parameter list in a function definition with the special
		'expression' <code>**kwargs</code> (meaning key word arguments), means
		that python will provide a dictionary inside function definition called
		'kwargs', containing all the parameters passed in in keyword form. The
		'**kwargs' can also be alone in the parameter list. Re-examining the
		radix example we have</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
#a simple function to change the radix (base) of a number, and return a string
#representing the number in the chosen radix
#this is most commonly used for hexadecimal notation, hence the default of 16

def radix(number, **kwargs):
    upper = "0123456789ABCDEF"
    lower = "0123456789abcdef"
    if "radix" in kwargs:
        r = kwargs["radix"]
    else:
        r = 16
    digits = lower
    if "case" in kwargs:
        if kwargs["case"] == "upper":
            digits = upper

    ret = ""
    while number &gt; 0:
        ret = digits[number % r] + ret
        number /= r
    return ret

print radix(17)
print radix(255, case = "upper")
print radix(17, radix = 8)
print radix(17, radix = 2)
print radix(17, case = "upper", radix = 12)
</pre>

		<p>Which gives us the following output</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
11
ff
21
10001
</pre>

		<p>Using <code>**kwargs</code> allows us to call the function and name
		the parameters we will assign values to explicitly, as opposed to
		implicitly by position. But for the same reasons default parameters
		must be specified after mandatory parameters, '**kwargs' must appear
		after default parameters (if any), otherwise after mandatory
		parameters.</p>

		<h2>Functions as Variable Values</h2>

		<p>As we have seen, we can refer to the function itself, as a value,
		without calling it by using the name of the function without round
		brackets and a parameter list. If we can refer to the function as a
		value, then we can assign that value to variable. Then we can use the
		variable to call the function. First a toy example for explanatory
		purposes.</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
#!/usr/bin/python

def plus(a, b):
    return a + b

def prod(a, b):
    return a * b

f = plus
f(4,5)
f = prod
f(4,5)
</pre>

		<p>As we can see, we are able to assign a function to a variable;
		<code>f = plus</code>. Next we see that we can call the function
		<strong>currently</strong> assigned to 'f' by using the same call
		syntax we would use with a function proper, namely using round braces
		and a parameter list; <code>f(4,5)</code>. Note that assigning a
		different function to 'f', and 'calling' 'f' again, we are in fact
		calling the newly assigned function.</p>

		<p>At first we might think this merely serves to confuse things, but
		there is a use for the concept of <strong>function pointers</strong> as
		they are called. Suppose we have a list, and we wish to apply a
		function to every to every element in that list, such that we obtain a
		new list containing the result of the function applied to the
		respective element in the original list. We could create an empty list,
		loop over the original list, and call the chosen function with each
		element of the original list as a parameter, appending the results to
		the new list. Now suppose we find that we perform this activity on a
		regular basis, so regular a basis that we would want to make a function
		to do this. The only problem is that the function we would want applied
		to the list changes. Which means we can't hard code it into our
		'application' function definition, but we must somehow accept the
		function to apply as a parameter to our 'application' function. Using
		function pointers we can do exactly this...</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
#!/usr/bin/python

#a short program to demonstrate the use of function pointer

#we define a functions that 'applies' a function to each element in a list, and
#returns a list of the results of that function. Both the list and the function
#are specified as parameters

def apply(f, l):
    ret = []
    for e in l:
        ret.append(f(e))
    return ret

#imagine we had received four 'numbers' from input calls, which means they
#are in fact strings
inputs = ["1", "2", "3", "4"]

#but we need them as integers
int_list = apply(int, inputs)
print int_list

#or perhaps even as floats
float_list = apply(float, inputs)

#or even converted to names of numbers

def nameofnum(n):
    return ["one", "two", "three", "four", "five"][int(n)-1]

name_list = apply(nameofnum, inputs)
