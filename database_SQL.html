		<h1>Introductory Programming in Python: Lesson 34<br />
		Structured Query Language</h1>

			[<a href="database_relational.html">Prev: Relational Databases</a>]&nbsp;[<a href="index.html">Course Outline</a>]&nbsp;[<a href="database_coding.html">Next: Interfacing with Databases using Python</a>]
		</div>

		<p>This lesson deals with standard structured query language (<a
		href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sql'>SQL</a>). SQL is a not a
		programming language as such, but rather, as its name suggests, a query
		language. It is a language designed specifically to let one phrase a
		complex question in a human readable but also machine parsable manner,
		that can extract arbitrary collection of data from a given database.</p>

		<p>The details of database administration are not part of the SQL
		standard, and as such not covered in this lesson (or this course for
		that matter). They are different for every implementation of SQL, and
		covered by each implementation's documentation. For the moment, it is
		assumed that you have an account on a database already set up. This
		lesson assumes a PostgreSQL database.</p>

		<h2>Starting the database client</h2>

		<p>The first thing to do is start up your database client. In a
		terminal, or command line window if using windows (Why are you still
		using Windows?), type <code>psql</code> for PostgreSQL:</p>

		<pre class='listing'>sirlark@hephaestus ~ $ psql
Welcome to psql 8.0.15, the PostgreSQL interactive terminal.

Type:  \copyright for distribution terms
       \h for help with SQL commands
       \? for help with psql commands
       \g or terminate with semicolon to execute query
       \q to quit

sirlark=></pre>

		<p>You are now connected to the PostgreSQL server, and are using the
		database named &lt;your username&gt; (in this case sirlark).</p>

		<p>For MySQL type <code>mysql -D &lt;your username&gt; -p</code>:</p>

		<pre class='listing'>sirlark@hephaestus ~ $ mysql -D sirlark -p
Enter password: 
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 5
Server version: 5.0.60-log Gentoo Linux mysql-5.0.60-r1

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

mysql> </pre>

		<h2>Creating a new database</h2>

		<p>While the creation of a new database is nominally an administrative
		issue, it is covered by the SQL standard. Quite simply we use the
		command <code>CREATE DATABASE &lt;database name&gt;;</code>. SQL
		commands are not case sensitive, though table names and column names may
		be depending on implementation, however it is common practice to use
		upper case for SQL specific keywords to make your queries more
		legible. Note the trailing semicolon. SQL is insensitive to the amount
		and nature of whitespace used, i.e. all whitespace is considered
		equivalent. As such a newline does not end a command. Instead all
		commands end is a semicolon.</p>

		<h2>Creating Tables</h2>

		<p>The first thing we want to do with any relational database is to
		specify its structure. We do this by creating tables, which initially
		contain no rows. The postgres client allows us to list all the tables
		present in the database using the command <code>\dt</code> (The MySQL
		equivalent is <code>SHOW TABLES</code>).</p>

		<p>Creating a new table is as simple as:</p>

		<pre class='definition'>CREATE TABLE &lt;table name&gt; (
&lt;column name&gt; &lt;type&gt; [&lt;constraints&gt;] [DEFAULT &lt;default value&gt;] [,
...
]
);</pre>

		<h3>Columns Types</h3>

		<p>Like python, relational databases have type, except they enforce the
		type of data present in a column of a table. Different implementations
		provide various different types, but the SQL standard specifies a shared
		collection of types available in all implementations.</p>

		<dl>

			<dt>[UNSIGNED] INTEGER</dt><dd>Nuf' said.</dd>

			<dt>FLOAT</dt><dd>Ditto</dd>
			
			<dt>DOUBLE</dt><dd>A bigger float</dd>

			<dt>NUMERIC(&lt;precision&gt;[, &lt;scale&gt;])</dt><dd>Numeric data
			with guaranteed precision. <em>Precision</em> is the total number of
			digits (maximum 1000), and scale is the number of digits to the
			right of the decimal point (default 0). NUMERIC data is slow to work
			with, compared to INTEGER and FLOAT, but provides guaranteed
			accuracy.</dd>

			<dt>VARCHAR(X)</dt><dd>String data up to X characters in
			length. X must be less than 256.</dd>

			<dt>CHAR(X)</dt><dd>String data up to X characters in length.
			Regardless of how many characters are present in the string X
			characters are stored on disk. Faster than VARCHAR, but uses more
			space. X must be less than 256.</dd>

			<dt>TEXT</dt><dd>String data of essentially indefinite length.
			Maximum length varies with implementation.</dd>

			<dt>DATE</dt><dd>A date</dd>

			<dt>TIME</dt><dd>A time</dd>
			
			<dt>YEAR</dt><dd>A four digit year</dd>

			<dt>TIMESTAMP [{WITH|WITHOUT} TIME ZONE]</dt><dd>A date and a time,
			optionally with automatic timezone conversion, which is the default.</dd>

			<dt>INTERVAL</dt><dd>A length of time, e.g. 3 days and 4 hours</dd>

			<dt>BOOLEAN</dt><dd>Either <em>TRUE</em> or <em>FALSE</em></dd>

		</dl>

		<p>There are many more standard SQL types, which you can find in the SQL
		standard, or in your database software documentation. The above types
		however will cover most of your bases.</p>

		<h3>Column Constraints</h3>

		<p>Although every column we specify must have a type, constraints are
		optional. Constraints are rules we specify that constrain not the type
		of data that may be stored in a column, but the content of that data.
		Constraints can be specified in any order. Some common constraint
		keywords are:</p>

		<dl>

			<dt>PRIMARY KEY</dt><dd>Indicates that this column should be
			considered the primary key of the table.</dd>
			
			<dt>UNIQUE</dt><dd>Indicates that entries in this column should be
			unique within this column of this table.</dd>
			
			<dt>[NOT] NULL</dt><dd>Species whether the column can have NULL
			values (the default), or whether every row must have an entry for
			this column.</dd>
			
			<dt>REFERENCES &lt;table name &gt;</dt><dd>Specifies this the
			contents of this column are foreign keys reference the primary key
			of the table 'table name'. No values can be stored in this column
			unless they exist in the primary key column of the table 'table
			name'.</dd>

		</dl>

		<h3>Specialised Primary Key Mechanisms</h3>

		<p>As mentioned before most database software allows the automatic
		generation of unique primary keys, however different software
		implementations do this in different ways, and there is no standard way
		to specify such behaviour in standard SQL.</p>

		<p>In PostgreSQL a special column type is provided, called
		<em>SERIAL</em>. Making a column, not necessarily a primary key, of type
		SERIAL will assign a default value that starts at 1 and increments by 1
		for every row inserted into the table that doesn't specify a value for
		that column.</p>

		<pre class='listing'>CREATE TABLE my_table (
	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	somestuff TEXT
);</pre>

		<p>The same functionality can be achieved, but only for columns which
		are primary keys, in MySQL using the AUTO_INCREMENT qualifier (which is
		essentially a constraint).</p>
		
		<pre class='listing'>CREATE TABLE my_table (
	id INTEGER AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
	somestuff TEXT
);</pre>

		<h3>Default Values</h3>

		<p>In addition to specifying column name, type and constraints, one may
		specify a default value for cases where rows are inserted without
		specifying the column in question. If no default is specified, the value
		becomes NULL. Defaults are specified with the in the form <code>DEFAULT
		&lt;value&gt;</code>, generally after any constraints.</p>

		<h3>Indexing</h3>

		<p>Finally, one can specify that an index be created for the table on
		the specified column, using the keyword <code>INDEX</code>. This is
		implied by the use of <em>PRIMARY KEY</em>, but other columns can be
		indexed for cases where they will be used often in queries. Indexing
		speeds up access and querying of the table when conditions using indexed
		columns are specified. The actual mechanisms of indexing and how they
		work are otherwise not worth going into in detail unless your intent is
		to become a professional database software developer.</p>

		<h3>Table Constraints</h3>

		<p>After all columns have been specified, additional <strong>table
		constraints</strong> can be specified. Most constraints can be specified
		using either column constraints or table constraints, but there are some
		constraints which are restricted by syntax to being specified only as
		table constraints.  In particular, constraints that span multiple
		columns, as in the multi-column primary key constraints of link tables
		used to represent many-to-many relationships. Some of these constraints
		are:</p>

		<dl>
			
			<dt>CONSTRAINT &lt;constraint name&gt; PRIMARY KEY (&lt;column
			name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;[, ...])</dt><dd>Acts in the same
			manner as the <em>PRIMARY KEY</em> column constraint when a single
			column is specified, but also allows primary keys of multiple
			columns to be specified.</dd>
		
			<dt>CONSTRAINT &lt;constraint name&gt; FOREIGN KEY (&lt;column
			name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;[, ...])<br />REFERENCES (&lt;table
			name&gt;)</dt><dd>Acts in the same manner as the
			<em>REFERENCES</em> column constraint when a single column is
			specified, but an be used to specify a combination of columns that
			act in concert as a single foreign key referencing a table with a
			primary key composed of the same number of columns and the same
			respective column types.</dd>
		
		</dl>

		<p>As an aside, it should be mentioned that as of this writing, MySQL
		does not enforce column foreign key constraints, but does parse them and
		ignore them without warning or comment.</p>

		<h3>An Example Database Creation Script</h3>

		<p>Let's get to practical grips with SQL now. Save the following
		listing to a file called library.sql, and pipe it into you database
		client...  <code>psql &lt; library.sql</code>. If you're using MySQL
		you will need to change all instances of 'SERIAL' to 'INTEGER
		AUTO_INCREMENT' in library.sql and use this command instead:
		<code>mysql -p &lt; library.sql</code>. This SQL script defines a new
		database to deal with the management of a small library, including
		searching for books by category, author name, or title, and managing
		their withdrawal and return by members.</p>

<pre class='listing'>
CREATE TABLE Category (
	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Book (
	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
	category INTEGER REFERENCES Category NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Author (
	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	surname VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
	firstname VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Authorship (
	author INTEGER REFERENCES Author NOT NULL,
	book INTEGER REFERENCES Book NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY (author, book)
);

CREATE TABLE Member (
	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	surname VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
	firstname VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
	address TEXT,
	phone CHAR(12),
	fax CHAR(12),
	signup_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE Withdrawal (
	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	withdrawal TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
	return TIMESTAMP NULL,
	book INTEGER REFERENCES Book NOT NULL,
	member INTEGER REFERENCES Member NOT NULL
);
</pre>

		<h2>Inserting Rows</h2>

		<p>Of course simply creating a data structure is not helpful unless we
		can populate it with data. Thus we come to the insertion of rows.</p>

<pre class='definition'>
INSERT INTO &lt;table name&gt; 
	(&lt;column name&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt;[, ...]]) 
VALUES 
	(&lt;value&gt;[, &lt;value&gt;[, ...]]);
</pre>

		<p>Very simply, the <em>INSERT</em> statement inserts a new rows into
		the table 'table name'. In the newly inserted row, the columns listed by
		name will be populated with the values listed, by respective position.
		String and text data needs to be enclosed in single quotes, integers,
		floats, numerics and boolean need not. Date and times also need to have
		single quotes and are always in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format for dates, and
		'hh:mm:ss' for times, and 'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss' for timestamps.</p>

		<p>Continuing with our library example, let's use the <em>INSERT</em>
		statement to populate out database with some information.</p>

<pre class='listing'>
INSERT INTO Category (name) VALUES ('Fiction');
INSERT INTO Category (name) VALUES ('Non-Fiction');
INSERT INTO Category (name) VALUES ('Reference');

INSERT INTO Book (title, category) VALUES ('Introductory Programming in Python', 2);
INSERT INTO Book (title, category)
	VALUES ('Lesser Known Molluscs of the Karoo Flood Plain', 2);
INSERT INTO Book (title, category) VALUES ('Advanced Programming Techniques', 2);
INSERT INTO Book (title, category) VALUES ('PostgreSQL Reference Manual', 3);
INSERT INTO Book (title, category) VALUES ('Pride &amp; Prejudice', 1);
INSERT INTO Book (title, category) VALUES ('The Time Machine', 1);
INSERT INTO Book (title, category) VALUES ('Day of the Triffids', 1);
INSERT INTO Book (title, category) VALUES ('The Bogus Book', 1);

INSERT INTO Author (surname, firstname) VALUES ('Dominy', 'James');
INSERT INTO Author (surname, firstname) VALUES ('Wells', 'Herbert George');
INSERT INTO Author (surname, firstname) VALUES ('Wyndham', 'John');
INSERT INTO Author (surname, firstname) VALUES ('Snailman', 'Fred B');
INSERT INTO Author (surname, firstname) VALUES ('Newman', 'Alfred E');
INSERT INTO Author (surname, firstname) VALUES ('Austen', 'Jane');

INSERT INTO Authorship (author, book) VALUES (1, 1);
INSERT INTO Authorship (author, book) VALUES (1, 2);
INSERT INTO Authorship (author, book) VALUES (5, 2);
INSERT INTO Authorship (author, book) VALUES (1, 3);
INSERT INTO Authorship (author, book) VALUES (5, 4);
INSERT INTO Authorship (author, book) VALUES (6, 5);
INSERT INTO Authorship (author, book) VALUES (2, 6);
INSERT INTO Authorship (author, book) VALUES (3, 7);
</pre>

		<h2>Updating Rows</h2>
		
		<p>We can modify the contents of rows that already exist in a table
		using the <em>UPDATE</em> statement.</p>

<pre class='definition'>
UPDATE &lt;table name&gt;
	SET &lt;column name&gt; = &lt;value&gt;[, &lt;column name&gt; = &lt;value&gt;[,...]]
	[WHERE &lt;condition&gt;];
</pre>

		<p>The <em>UPDATE</em> statements updates the contents of
		<strong>all</strong> rows in the specified table, unless a WHERE clause
		is given, in which case only rows that match the condition are updated.
		Usually the condition will be of the form <code>WHERE prikey = &lt;some
		id&gt;</code>, but more general updates can be useful. For example one
		might want to update all rows in a table that have a date column with
		values before 5 years ago, such that their 'archived' column becomes
		true, because they have cycled out of the active tax storage
		requirements.</p>

		<p>By the way, in our example library database, one of the authorship
		records is wrong, so we should update it. James Dominy knows nothing
		about molluscs, and Fred Snailman is in fact the correct author.</p>

<pre class='listing'>
UPDATE Authorship SET author = 4 WHERE author = 1 AND book = 2;
</pre>

		<h2>Deleting Rows</h2>

		<p>Obviously, over time we will need to delete records from out
		database. Again, simply done with the <em>DELETE</em> statement.</p>

<pre class='definition'>
DELETE FROM &lt;table name&gt; [WHERE &lt;condition&gt;];
</pre>

		<p>Note that the <em>DELETE</em> statement deletes all rows from the
		table unless a WHERE clause is provided, in which case only those rows
		matching the specified condition are removed. Rows cannot be removed if
		they are referred to by a foreign key in another table, i.e. removal is
		blocked if such a removal would cause a violation of the foreign key
		constraints of the database.</p> 

		<p>Let's get rid of the bogus book in our example library database.</p>

<pre class='listing'>
DELETE FROM Book WHERE id = 8;
</pre>

		<h2>Querying Information</h2>

		<p>The true power behind SQL is the ability to dynamically specify what
		information we want from the database. This is done using the
		<em>SELECT</em> statement. The <em>SELECT</em> statement is possibly the
		most complex statement in the SQL language, so we'll deal with it by
		example, starting simple, and expanding from there.</p>

		<h3>Simple SELECT Statements</h3>

		<p>We'll start out with a simple single table query; What titles are
		available in our library?</p>

<pre class='listing'>
SELECT title FROM Book;
</pre>

		<p>As we can see the <em>SELECT</em> statement follows the form
		<code>SELECT &lt;column name&gt; FROM &lt;table name&gt;;</code>. But
		getting only the values from a single column is not particularly useful.
		What about data from multiple columns at once?</p>

<pre class='listing'>
SELECT title, category FROM Book;
</pre>
	
		<p>Okay, so we can list multiple columns from the table in comma
		separated list. But what if we don't want all the rows from the table?
		What if we only want to see non-fiction books?</p>

<pre class='listing'>
SELECT title, category FROM Book WHERE category = 2;
</pre>

		<h3>Inner Joins</h3>

		<p>Great! But displaying the numbers for categories and having to use
		those numbers for our conditions is annoying. So how do we implement one
		of those infamous join thingies?</p>

<pre class='listing'>
SELECT Book.title, Category.name
FROM Book
JOIN Category ON Category.id = Book.category
WHERE category = 2;
</pre>
		
		<p>Reasonably obvious! After we've specified the main table to query
		from using FROM, we can specify which tables to join onto it with a JOIN
		clause. The JOIN clause specifies which table to join (Category in this
		case) and which row from the table being joined should be joined to the
		FROM table, using 'ON' and a condition (for each row in book find all
		rows in Category with an id equal to the category column in Book,
		combine the rows, add put them in the result table). Since we are now
		dealing with multiple tables in a single query we need to prefix column
		names with the table names they come from, hence 'Category.id' to
		distinguish it from 'Book.id'.</p>

		<p>Performing a join creates a resultant table with all the columns from
		all the tables joined together. The SELECT statement then extracts only
		the columns of interest. So while the above query only shows two
		columns, the join itself produces a table with five columns.</p>

		<h3>Left Joins</h3>

		<p>So now we can join tables, but in doing so we exclude certain rows.
		How do we, for example, obtain a list of all categories and their books,
		even if there are no books in a category. First let's add such a
		category to the library database, then we'll perform the query.</p>

<pre class='listing'>
INSERT INTO Category (name) VALUES ('Periodical');

SELECT Category.name, Book.title
FROM Category
LEFT JOIN Book ON Book.category = Category.id;
</pre>

		<p>Aha! We can now see all categories, even the new one without any
		associated books. The results show a row with NULL in the place of the
		book title for the category 'Periodical'. This is because no row from
		book could be found to join to the 'Periodical' row from Category, but
		because we used a <em>LEFT JOIN</em> all rows already present in the
		left hand side of the join will be preserved and the right side of the
		join will be filled with NULL's where necessary.</p>

		<h3>Implicit Inner Joins using WHERE</h3>

		<p>We can also specify multiple tables in the FROM clause, and their
		respective join conditions in the WHERE clause. This always implies an
		INNER JOIN join though (i.e. a normal exclusive JOIN, and not a LEFT
		JOIN)</p>

<pre class='listing'>
SELECT Book.title, Category.name
FROM Book, Category 
WHERE Category.id = Book.category AND category = 2;
</pre>
		<h3>Aggregation using GROUP BY</h3>

		<p>We can also display how many books are in each category.</p>

<pre class='listing'>
SELECT Category.name, count(Book.id)
FROM Category
LEFT JOIN Book on Book.category = Category.id
GROUP BY Category.name;
</pre>

		<p>Note the use of the function 'count'. SQL provides a number of
		aggregation functions which can used to calculate values over multiple
		rows of selected data. Aggregation functions are always used in
		conjunction with a <em>GROUP BY</em> clause. If no GROUP BY clause is
		specified, then the entire selection of rows is treated as a single
		group, otherwise rows with the same values in the specified column of
		the GROUP BY clause are grouped together. Each distinct value of the
		column (or distinct combination of values if multiple columns are
		specified) are treated as a group. Some commonly used aggregation
		functions are:</p>

		<dl>

			<dt>count()</dt><dd>Returns the number of rows in the group.</dd>

			<dt>sum()</dt><dd>Returns the sum of the values of the specified
			column, which must obviously have a numeric (not NUMERIC) type.</dd>

			<dt>avg()</dt><dd>Returns the average of the values of the specified
			column, which must obviously have a numeric type.</dd>

		</dl>

		<h3>Sorting with ORDER BY</h3>

		<p>Finally, we can sort the results eventually displayed.</p>

<pre class='listing'>
SELECT Category.name, count(Book.id) as number
FROM Category
LEFT JOIN Book on Book.category = Category.id
GROUP BY Category.name
ORDER BY Category.name;
</pre>

		<p>And as can be seen below, we can specify sub-sorting and whether the
		sort should be ascending (the default) or descending (DESC)</p>

<pre class='listing'>
SELECT Category.name, count(Book.id)
FROM Category
LEFT JOIN Book on Book.category = Category.id
GROUP BY Category.name, Book.title
ORDER BY Category.name DESC, Book.title;
</pre>

		<h2>Aliasing</h2>

		<p>If our table names are long, or we're just lazy, it can become a pain
		to type out full table names when differentiating column names. SQL
		allows us to create on the fly aliases for both table names and column
		names. Observe:</p>

<pre class='listing'>
SELECT C.name as category, count(B.id) as number
FROM Category as C
LEFT JOIN Book as B on B.category = C.id
GROUP BY C.name
ORDER BY number;
</pre>

		<p>Here we are dealing with two different types of aliases, although
		they both have the same syntax. We can, for the scope of the current
		query, alias either a column name or a table name by following it with
		<code>as &lt;alias&gt;</code>.</p>

		<p>Aliasing column names affects the actual output of the query, in that
		the column headings printed out (or returned to your program if
		connecting to the database from python), which are generally automatically
		assigned to be the names of the columns chosen, are overridden by any
		alias names provided. As above, 'C.name' will now be named 'category'
		instead of 'name' in the output. Another use of aliasing is that it
		provides us with an easy way to reference aggregate columns in 'ORDER
		BY' or 'WHERE' clauses, as done here with 'number'.</p>

		<p>Aliasing tables with 'as' in the FROM and JOIN clauses allows us to
		use the alias names to specify table differentiation of columns
		throughout the rest of query.</p>

		<h2>Dropping a table</h2>

		<p>We can get rid of an entire table, assuming there are no rows in the
		table which are still pointed to by foreign keys in other tables of
		course, by issuing the <code>DROP TABLE &lt;table name&gt;;</code>
		command. There's no undo, and asking for confirmation on this. Be
		sure!</p>

		<h2>Dropping an entire database</h2>

		<p>Similarly, we can drop an entire database. Again, no confirmation, no
		undo!</p>

<pre class='definition'>
DROP DATABASE &lt;database name&gt;;
</pre>
	
		<h2>Transactions</h2>

		<p>One other cool thing about relational database management systems
		(RDBMS) is the concept of atomic transactions. Transactions allow one
		to group together SQL commands into a single atomic unit, known as a
		transaction. The commands are executed in sequence, but if one of the
		commands does not complete successfully, the database is rolled back to
		the point prior to the transaction starting, i.e. it's all or nothing.
		This is very useful when we want to insert multiple different rows into
		different tables that all refer to one another. If the connection goes
		dead mid insertion process, we don't want half the data there with
		foreign keys potentially unsatisfied. Instead we'd rather know that the
		whole thing failed, nothing was changed, and that if we redo from
		scratch it won't fail because unique keys already exists.</p>

		<p>We start a transaction with <code>BEGIN;</code>, and everything
		entered up until <code>END;</code> becomes part of the transaction. Once
		the <em>END</em> command is issued, the entire transaction is executed
		at once. Actually, the commands are executed as you type them in, but if
		one causes an error, no more commands are valid until the 'END' of the
		transaction, the all commands will be automatically undone.</p>
