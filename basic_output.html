<h2>The print() Statement</h2>

<p>The most basic statement in Python is "print()". The print()
  statement causes whatever is between the brackets to be outputted to the screen.
  We've already encountered it previously, now it's time to understand
  how it works. Start up the python interactive shell, and let's explore.
  Type the following:</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
Python 2.6.4 (r264:75706, Dec 7 2009, 18:43:55) [MSC v.1310 32 bit (Intel)] on win32 
[GCC 3.4.6 (Gentoo 3.4.6-r1, ssp-3.4.5-1.0, pie-8.7.9)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(1)
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(173+92)
265
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(173+92.0)
265.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; print("hello")
hello
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

<p>As one can see, the print() statement outputs the
  <strong>value</strong> of the expression immediately following it to
  the screen, and moves to the next line. Note that the third print
  statement produces slightly different output, namely the extra '.0'.
  This is because 92.0 and 92 are different to a computer. 92 is an
  integer, whilst 92.0 is a real number, or in computing terms a
  <strong>floating point number</strong> or <strong>float</strong> for short. The
  differences will be covered later.</p>

<p>Also of importance is the expression "hello" (note the double
  quotes). The value of "hello" is <em>hello</em>, and this is what is
  outputted to the screen by the print() statement. <em>hello</em> is
  designated as a <strong>string</strong> by enclosing it in quotes. Try
  <code>print(hello)</code> without the quotes and see what happens.</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(hello)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in ?
NameError: name 'hello' is not defined
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

<p>What's going on? Welcome to your first bug! We will soon learn to dissect and
  understand what all that means, but for the moment it is sufficient to
  understand that something has gone wrong. But what? Recall from basic
  concepts we were able to store values in 'labels' or 'variables'.
  Python consists of a limited set of key words that have special
  meaning. These key words form the list of basic (atomic) statements and
  expressions that python knows how to handle. Whenever python encounters
  a word is doesn't recognise, it treats this as a label name. It
  obviously doesn't recognise 'hello' as a statement, and thus treats it as
  a <strong>variable</strong>. Variables must have a value, because
  variables are expressions in and of themselves. But we haven't told
  python what the value of hello is, hence it complains "'hello' is not
  defined".</p>

<p>The print() statement is not so plain and boring as it seems. It can
  do a few more things that bear mention. Try entering <code>print("Jane
    has", 7, "apples.")</code></p>

		<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; print("Jane has", 7, "apples")
Jane has 7 apples
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

<p>Of course we could just as easily use <code>print("Jane has 7
  apples")</code> and get the same result. However, separating the number
  7 out illustrates two important things about the print() statement.
  Firstly, we can in fact output the values of any number of expressions
  in a comma separated list, and secondly the outputs of each of the
  expressions in the comma separated list are separated by a single space
  each.</p>

<p>Finally, you will notice that the print() statement always ends off
  the line, and starts a new one. Simply leaving a comma on the end
  prevents this, e.g. <code>print("Enter your name:",)</code>. In summary:</p>

<ul>

  <li>The print statement prints out the <em>values</em>  between the
    brackets and then prints a new line</li>

  <li>An empty print() statement ends the current line and starts a new
    one.</li>

  <li>The print statement can print() multiple expressions if they are
    given in a <em>comma separated</em> list. In this case, a space is
    included between each expression's outputted value.</li>

  <li>The automatic newline outputted by print() can be avoided by
    putting a trailing comma in the expression list. This will print a
    trailing space instead.</li>

  <li>If a print() statement with a trailing comma is followed by an
    <em>empty</em> print() statement, the trailing space is
    suppressed.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Some String Basics</h2>

<p>Python treats all text in units called <strong>strings</strong>. A <strong>string</strong> is formed
  by enclosing some text in quotes. Double quotes, or single quotes may
  be used. There is a small limitation to this however, being that a
  string cannot be broken across multiple lines.</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
'this is a string of text'
"this is also a string of text"
'this string will
    cause an error, because it spans multiple lines'
</pre>

<p>Trying to enter the third string into the interactive shell yields</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'this string will
    File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1
            'this string will
                            ^
SyntaxError: EOL while scanning single-quoted string
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

<p>EOL meaning End Of Line. If we want to introduce line breaks into
  strings we can use two methods. The first, and simplest, is to use
  'triple quotes', meaning three double or three single quotes to indicate
  both the beginning and the end of the string, as in</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; """this string will not
...  cause an error
...    just because it is split over three lines"""
'this string will not\n  cause an error\n    just because it is split over three lines'
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

<p>The immediately obvious disadvantage is that everything between the
  triple quotes is taken as-is, meaning the second and third lines of my
  string which I indented to line up with the beginning of the first line
  are indented in the string itself in the form of three spaces after
  those '\n' thingies. Speaking of which, what the hell are those things?
  Why does our string contain stuff we didn't put there? Well let's try
  to print the string out ...</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; print("""this string will not
...    cause an error
...    just because it is split over three lines""")
this string will not
   cause an error
   just because it is split over three lines
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

<p>Well the '\n's are gone, but what were they? Strings are sequences
  of characters and are one dimensional. They have no
  <strong>implicit</strong> way to specify a line break, or relative
  position, or which characters are where relative to which other
  characters in the string in two dimensions, as displayed on a screen.
  Hence we get the second method of specifying line breaks within a
  string. There are special characters known as <strong>escape
    characters</strong> which mean special things inside strings. They all
  start with a backslash '\' which escapes the following character from
  the string, or in layman's terms means the following character in the
  string is not a 'normal character' and should be treated specially.
  Some important escape characters are</p>

<dl>
  <dt>\n</dt>

  <dd>line break or New line (n from the n in new line)</dd>

  <dt>\t</dt>

  <dd>tab</dd>

  <dt>\\</dt>

  <dd>a plain backslash</dd>
</dl>

<p>You will see that because a backslash already has a special meaning,
  namely "treat the next character specially", we can't simply put a
  backslash into our string. So we escape the backslash with a second
  backslash, meaning we actually want a backslash and not a special
  character.</p>

<p>Finally, how do we actually put quotes inside a string since they
  indicate the <strong>end</strong> of a string. The easiest solution is
  to mix your quotes. If you want a single quote in a string, define the
  string with double quotes, e.g.  <code>"I've got this escape thing all
    figured out!"</code>. Alternatively, you can actually escape quotes
  within strings, to give them the special meaning that they don't end
  the string, e.g. <code>'I\'ve got this escaped thing totally figured
    out!'</code></p>
