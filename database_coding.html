		<p>Now that we have a grip on SQL and its use via a database client, we
		want to be able to do the thing from within a python script. Ideally we
		we would like to extract information from the database into native
		python data structures, rather than as text we have to parse, and in
		fact there are a variety of python modules available that allow us to do
		exactly this. Different modules are required for different RDBMSs, but
		python has defined a standard interface for such modules, called the
		Python DB API. All modules subscribing to this interface standard
		operate in a nearly manner.</p>

		<h2>Opening a Connection to the Database</h2>

		<p>We're going to look at three database interface modules; psycopg,
		pypgsql, and mysqldb. The first two interface with PostgreSQL, and the
		third with MySQL. None of these modules comes standard with python, but
		the installation details are once again dependant on OS and
		distribution. Despite having just claimed the database interfaces are
		standardised in Python, the exception that proves the rule is of course
		the first thing we have to deal with. As mentioned previously, different
		RDBMSs use different authentication methods, and as a result connection
		methods are fundamentally different. Let's connect to our library
		example database. We assume that the database is called 'library', and
		that we are connecting to a database server running locally.</p>

<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; import psycopg2
&gt;&gt;&gt; conn = psycopg2.connect(user='james', password='james', database='library')
</pre>

<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; from pyPgSQL import PgSQL
&gt;&gt;&gt; conn = PgSQL.connect(user='james', password='james', database='library')
</pre>

<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; import MySQLdb
&gt;&gt;&gt; conn = MySQLdb.connect(user='james', passwd='james')
&gt;&gt;&gt; conn.select_db("library")
</pre>

		<p>Here we can see that calling the connect function from our chosen
		database module returns what is known as a connection object.</p>

		<p>We can also connect to remote database servers by passing the extra
		keyword argument 'host' and giving a hostname as the value, and if the
		server is running on a non-default port, we can use the 'port' keyword
		specify a port.</p>

		<h2>Cursors</h2>

		<p>While RDBMSs are capable of treating collections of rows as singular
		units, procedural languages like python are often forced to deal with
		such collections rows by row. The concept of a <strong>cursor</strong>
		was introduced, which provides a method of iterating through collections
		of rows. For the most part the technicalities of cursors are
		unimportant, their just a way for python to get rows one at a time.</p>

		<p>We still need to create a cursor to use though, which we do by using
		the connection object to instantiate a cursor object.</p>

<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; curs = conn.cursor()
</pre>
		
		<h2>Executing Queries</h2>

		<p>Using the cursor object we can now send SQL commands as a string.
		Let's ask for the titles of all books in the fiction category.</p>

<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; curs.execute('SELECT title FROM Book WHERE category = 1')
</pre>
		
		<p>Cursors act as generators, which are initially empty. A generator in
		python is an object that acts similarly to a list, in that we can loop
		over it using a for loop. When we use a cursor to execute a query, the
		generator 'fills up' with the rows returned by the database. When we
		extract these rows, using a for loop for example (indexing does not work
		with generators), they are returned as tuples. Cursors also provide
		methods to extract the next row, and all remaining rows.<p>

<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; curs.fetchone()
('Pride & Prejudice',)
&gt;&gt;&gt; curs.fetchall()
[('The Time Machine',), ('Day of the Triffids',)]
>>> curs.fetchall()
[]
</pre>

		<p>We can see that after we have fetched all the rows from the database,
		the cursor returns an empty list. We have to issue a new query to
		produce more results to fetch.</p>

<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; curs.execute('SELECT * FROM Book as B 
... JOIN Authorship as A ON A.book = B.id AND A.author = 1')
&gt;&gt;&gt; for row in curs:
...     print row
... 
(1, 'Introductory Programming in Python', 2, 1, 1)
(3, 'Advanced Programming Techniques', 2, 1, 3)
</pre>

		<h2>Executing Modification Queries</h2>

		<p>Queries that effect changes to the database are not automatically
		run. We must 'commit' them. This is done to allow for referential
		integrity across multiple queries. More simply put, if we have many
		queries, each updating or inserting information in(to) the database, and
		we are changing or creating foreign keys specifically, we want some
		queries to be treated as a single transaction. For example, we don't
		want to create a book entry, but then have the connection cut before an
		associated authorship entry is created. The python DB API does not
		automatically commit any queries that change the database until we
		explicitly tell it do so by using the commit method of the connection
		object. First we'll look at the PostgreSQL method, then the MySQL method</p>

<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; curs.execute("INSERT INTO Book (name) VALUES ('Stanger in a Strange Land')")
&gt;&gt;&gt; curs.execute("SELECT * FROM currval('Book_id_seq')")
&gt;&gt;&gt; bookid = curs.next()[0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; curs.execute("INSERT INTO Author (surname, firstname)
... VALUES ('Heinlein', 'Robert A')")
&gt;&gt;&gt; curs.execute("SELECT * FROM currval('Author_id_seq')")
&gt;&gt;&gt; authorid = curs.next()[0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; curs.execute("""INSERT INTO Authorship (book, author)
... VALUES (%i, %i)""")%(bookid, authorid)
&gt;&gt;&gt; conn.commit()
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; curs.execute("INSERT INTO Book (name) VALUES ('Stanger in a Strange Land')")
&gt;&gt;&gt; bookid = conn.insert_id()
&gt;&gt;&gt; curs.execute("INSERT INTO Author (surname, firstname)
... VALUES ('Heinlein', 'Robert A')")
&gt;&gt;&gt; authorid = conn.insert_id()
&gt;&gt;&gt; curs.execute("""INSERT INTO Authorship (book, author)
... VALUES (%i, %i)""")%(bookid, authorid)
&gt;&gt;&gt; conn.commit()
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

		<p>Again we see a difference in the way the database servers choose to
		implement certain functionality. One of the other reasons for
		transactions is avoid problems with concurrent usage. When we insert the
		Authorship link, we need to know the primary key ids of the Book and
		Author rows we have just inserted. RDBMSs provide methods to obtain this
		information in various ways. PostgreSQL for examples automatically
		creates a sequence object whenever a column of type SERIAL is created.
		This sequence is named '&lt;table name&gt;_&lt;column name&gt;_seq' and
		its current value can be accessed using the query <code>SELECT
		currval('&lt;sequence name&gt;');</code>. PostgreSQL chooses this method
		because a single table may may multiple serial columns. MySQL, on the
		other hand, only allows a single AUTO_INCREMENT column, which must be a
		primary key. As a result, a MySQL cursor object in python has the method
		<code>&lt;cursor object&gt;.insert_id()</code> which is an integer equal
		to the integer primary key of the last row inserted by the cursor
		object.<p>

		<p>The problem comes in when multiple users are using the database at
		the same time. Suppose we insert a rows, but before we can query the
		insertion id, someone else inserts a row. We would end up getting the
		wrong insertion id. Transactions avoid this, by guaranteeing that our
		entire set of commands are executed in an atomic fashion, i.e.
		completely or not at all, <strong>and</strong> in an exclusive manner,
		i.e. no other transaction can interrupt our own.</p>

		<p>Until the call to the commit method is made, nothing is changed in
		the database. If the connection is broken, no changes are made, all
		'changes' are lost. We will still receive appropriate error messages
		from that database engine, meaning we can use this technique to test
		whether a set of queries will work, and if not, cancel them all at once,
		by simply closing the cursor with <code>&lt;cursor
		object&gt;.close()</code> method. Once an error has occurred 'in' a
		particular cursor object, any attempt at execution via that object will
		raise an exception to the effect that the transaction has been
		aborted. Close the cursor, and start again!</p>
		
		<p>Executing a read-only query automatically commits any pending
		queries.</p>

		<h2>Rollbacks</h2>

		<p>The connection object has a method <code>&lt;connection
		object&gt;.rollback()</code>. When called, this performs what is known
		as a rollback, essentially undoing any modification made to the database
		by this connection.<p>

		<h2>Closing Connections</h2>

		<p>Finally, when we are done, we must close our any open cursors and our
		connection to the database. This is vitally important, as the database
		engine itself maintains resources on the other side of the connection,
		so if we don't inform the engine we are closing the connection, those
		resources may be kept, wasting memory. Closing the connection does not
		automatically commit any pending queries.</p>
