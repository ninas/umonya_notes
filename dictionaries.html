		<h2>What are dictionaries</h2>

		<p>Dictionaries in python are known in other languages by other names,
		including "associative arrays" and "mappings". The latter being perhaps
		the more explanatory term. Dictionaries are basically a set of mappings
		from a <strong>key</strong> to a <strong>value</strong>. Keys can be of
		any non-mutable type, and values can be of any type including other
		dictionaries, lists, or tuples. Dictionaries specify a set of key:value
		pairs, such that when the dictionary is subscripted using a key it
		contains, the value associated with that pair is returned.</p>

		<h2>Forming a Dictionary</h2>

		<p>Dictionaries are formed using curly braces (<code>{ }</code>), and
		providing a comma separated list of key:value pairs between the open
		and close braces.</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = {
... 0: "This is the value for key 0",
... 1: "This is the value for key 1",
... "3": "See how keys can also be strings",
... (4, 5): "Or even tuples",
... "and for fun": 7
... }
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

		<p>Here we have a new dictionary, which we have assigned to a variable
		'a'. The dictionary contains five key:value pairs, each specified using
		the format <code>&lt;key&gt; : &lt;value&gt;</code> within a comma
		separated list within curly braces. Note how keys can be of multiple
		different types within the same dictionary. <strong>Key order is not
		guaranteed by python</strong>. Similarly values can be of any type, and
		types can be mixed within one dictionary. Also note the existence of
		the empty dictionary ...</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = {}
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

		<h2>Using Dictionaries</h2>

		<p>Presumably, the first thing we would want to be able to do after
		forming a dictionary is to manipulate the key:value pairs. We would
		want to be able to extract individual pairs by their key name, which we
		do by using the subscription operator
		<code>&lt;dictionary&gt;[&lt;expression&gt;]</code></p>

		<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[0]
'This is the value for key 0'
&gt;&gt;&gt; a["3"]
'See how keys can also be strings'
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[4,5]
'Or even tuples'
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

		<p>In a similar way to lists we can change the contents of a
		dictionary, meaning <strong>dictionaries are mutable</strong>.
		Specifically, we can change the value of a certain key using the
		assignment statement <code>&lt;dictionary&gt;[&lt;expression&gt;] =
		&lt;expression&gt;</code>.</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; a["3"] = "Told you keys could also be strings"
&gt;&gt;&gt; a["3"]
'Told you keys could also be strings'
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

		<p>Similarly, a simple assignment statement can add a new key:value
		pair to a dictionary, as long as the key doesn't already exist in the
		dictionary. If the key does already exist, it's value is simply changed
		as in the assignment statement above.</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; a["new"] = "a new pair has been added"
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
{0: 'This is the value for key 0', 1: 'This is the value for key 1', '3': 'Told
you keys could also be strings', 'new': 'a new pair has been added', (4, 5): 'Or
even tuples'}
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

		<p>It is important to realise, that this implicit replacement of the
		values of already extant keys ensures that keys are unique. Also, note
		that attempting to access a key that doesn't exist causes an
		error...</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[3]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in ?
KeyError: 3
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

		<p>Which means that before we can add to the value of a particular key
		using an assignment such as<br /> <code>a["n"] = a["n"] + 1</code> we
		must first ensure the key exists to add to. The same is of course true
		of any operator applied to a key's value. The reason for this is that
		assignments evaluate the expression on the right of the equals before
		assigning it to the variable on the left, meaning the value of a["n"]
		would be looked up before it has been put into the dictionary, causing
		an error.</p>

		<p>Entire dictionaries can be compared using the standard comparison
		operators. If 'a' and 'b' are both dictionaries</p>

		<ul>

			<li><code>a == b</code> yields Equivalence. True only if both
			'a' and 'b' contain exactly the same set of key:value pairs.</li>

			<li><code>a &lt; b</code>, <code>a &lt;= b</code> yield Less
			Than<br /> Since the order of the keys in a dictionary are not
			guaranteed, I'm not sure how this is useful, or how the comparison
			is done. Suffice it to say it is possible, but I've never seen it
			used.</li>

			<li><code>a &gt; b</code>, <code>a &gt;= b</code> yield Greater
			Than<br /> See 'Less Than'</li>

			<li><code>a is b</code> is True only if 'a' and 'b' are synonyms
			for the same dictionary.</li>

		</ul>

		<p>We can loop over the keys of a dictionary, using a for
		statement.</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; for k in a:
...     print k
... 
0
1
3
new
(4, 5)
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

		<p>Or perhaps more usefully, we can loop over the keys, and use them as
		indexes into the dictionary.</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; for k in a:
...     print k, ":", a[k]
... 
0 : This is the value for key 0
1 : This is the value for key 1
3 : Told you keys could also be strings
new : a new pair has been added
(4, 5) : Or even tuples
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

		<p>Finally, we can extract various structures from a dictionary in the
		form of lists.</p>

		<ul>

			<li>

				<code>&lt;dictionary&gt;.values()</code> returns a list
				containing all values in the dictionary. The order of these
				values is not guaranteed.

				<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.values()
['This is the value for key 0', 'This is the value for key 1', 'Told you keys
could also be strings', 'a new pair has been added', 'Or even tuples']
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
			</li>

			<li>

				<code>&lt;dictionary&gt;.keys()</code> returns a list
				containing all keys in the dictionary. The order of these keys
				is not guaranteed.

				<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.keys()
[0, 1, '3', 'new', (4, 5)]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
			</li>

			<li>

				<code>&lt;dictionary&gt;.items()</code> returns a list
				containing tuples of all key:value pairs in the dictionary,
				where key is the first element of the tuple, and value the
				second. The order of these pairs is not guaranteed.

				<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.items()
[(0, 'This is the value for key 0'), (1, 'This is the value for key 1'), ('3',
'Told you keys could also be strings'), ('new', 'a new pair has been added'),
((4, 5), 'Or even tuples')]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
			</li>

		</ul>

		<h2>Exercises</h2>

		<p>Given the code:</p>

<pre class='listing'>
d = {
    "fruits": ["apples", "oranges", "pears", "mangoes"],
    "vegetables": ["tomatoes", "lettuce", "spinach", "green peppers"],
    "meat": ["chicken", "fish", "beef", "ostrich"],
    "dairy": ["yogurt", "milk", "cheese", "ice-cream"]
}</pre>

		<ol>

			<li>How many keys does <em>d</em> have?</li>
			
			<li>How many values does <em>d</em> have?</li>

			<li>What is the value of <code>d["meat"]</code>?</li>

			<li>What is the value of <code>d["dairy"][2]</code>?</li>

			<li>How do you access "spinach" using the dictionary <em>d</em>?</li>

			<li>How do you add a new fruit?</li>

			<li>Consider the set of key:value pairs?
				<ul>
					<li>"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy": 1</li>
					<li>"The Restaurant at the End of the Universe": 2</li>
					<li>"Life, the Universe, and Everything": 3</li>
					<li>"So Long, and Thanks for all the Fish!": 4</li>
					<li>"Mostly Harmless": 5</li>
				</ul>

				<ol>
				
					<li>How do you create this set as a dictionary in
					python?</li>

					<li>How do you find which book in the 'trilogy', i.e. what
					number, "The Restaurant at the End of the Universe"
					is?</li>

					<li>Write a program that starts by declaring the above
					dictionary as a literal, and outputs the books in
					order.</li>

					<li>Write a program that starts by declaring the above
					dictionary as a literal, and then asks the user for a
					number, and prints out name of the book which has the given
					number.</li>

					<li>Write a program the starts by declaring the above
					dictionary as a literal, then proceeds to switch the keys
					and values, so that values become keys, and <i>vice
					versa</i>.  Print out the resulting dictionary</li>

				</ol>

			</li>

			<li>Write a program that reads in names until a blank line is
			entered, and prints out each unique name and the number of times
			it was entered.</li>

			<li>Write a program the reads strings until a blank line is
			encountered. For each string entered, treat the portion of the
			string up to the first colon (or the entire string if no colon is
			present) as a key name, and everything after the first colon as a
			value. If the key portion has been entered before, print out the old
			value paired with that key, and then change the value to the newly
			entered one. After the blank line, print out a neat list of key
			value pairs.</li>
			
			<li>A small arts and crafts store owner in the middle of the Karoo
			has recently upgraded to a computerised point of sale system, and
			wants to do the same for his guest book. Customers have previously
			left their names a small paragraph of comment in the book. The owner
			would like his customers to be able to walk up to a computer near
			the exit, type in their names, and enter a brief comment. He's only
			interested in a customer's most recent comments, and doesn't want
			store old comments. So repeat customer's must be able to update
			their previous comments. When a repeat customer types in their name,
			their previous comment is displayed back to them, and they are
			afforded the opportunity to enter a new comment. Should they enter a
			blank line instead of a comment, their previous comment is
			preserved. Also, if instead of a customer name the special command
			'quit' is entered, the program exits. Similarly the command
			'showcomments' causes all customers' names to be displayed, followed
			by their comments slightly indented. Customer's must be able to
			enter their names in a case insensitive manner.</li>

			<li>Extend your solution to the previous problem, by allowing
			customers to enter multi-line comments, and to terminate their
			comments by entering a blank line. If the comment is entirely
			blank, i.e. the first line is blank, then it does not overwrite the
			former comment if any. Also, ensure that when the comments are
			outputted back, either because of the 'showcomments' command, or a
			repeat customer entering their name, that the line width of the
			outputted comments does not exceed 60 characters, nor break a word
			in two, i.e. lines are only broken on white space.</li>

			<li>What happens if you make an element of a dictionary point to
			itself.</li>
