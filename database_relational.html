		<h2>How Scientists Store Data: or Why Spreadsheets are a Bad Idea</h2>

		<p>Ahh ... Scientists! The brightest of the bright, smartest of the
		smart; Capable of amazing intellectual feats, excluding anything to do
		with a VCR, or apparently sensible data storage. It has long been known
		(read: The author is to lazy to look up the original reference, or any
		reference at all for that matter) that most non-computer science
		students and academics store their experimental/empirical data in the
		form of an Excel spreadsheet. This is quite possibly the
		<strong>worst</strong> way to store data. First let's examine why Excel
		is such a popular choice:</p>
		
		<ol>

			<li>Excel is a GUI.</li>

			<li>People are familiar with Excel.</li>

			<li>Excel gives the illusion of structure being imposed on the data
			stored in the form of column names.</li>

			<li>Excel can create pretty pictures.</li>

			<li>Excel can perform rudimentary data manipulation, e.g.
			sorting.</li>

			<li>Excel can perform rudimentary analysis on the data, e.g.
			regression.</li>

		</ol>
		
		<p>Now let's look at the reasons Excel is a bad choice:</p>

		<ol>

			<li>Excel is a GUI... its primary purpose is not to store and
			structure data but to analyse it.</li>

			<li>Excel does not in fact impart any structure to the data.
			Regardless of what I name the column, the cells under those
			columns can contain any data of any data type.</li>

			<li>More importantly, Excel does not <em>enforce</em> any structure
			on the data.</li>

			<li>It's ridiculously easy to make large scale incorrect changes to
			data... Have you ever sorted by a column and discovered the other
			columns didn't sort with it?</li>

			<li>Excel doesn't keep data together in an <em>identifiable</em>
			structured manner.</li>

		</ol>

		<h2>Why Unique Identifiers are Useful</h2>
		
		<p>Most scientists make an attempt to organise their data. They label
		all their physical specimens carefully and explicitly. First mistake!
		The label 'Blood Sample Joe Blogs 2008-03-14 Stage 3 infection' is
		probably very helpful to someone looking at the name on a computer
		screen, but try finding that vial of blood when you have only 10 seconds
		to read the label while it is out of the liquid nitrogen before it thaws
		too much to be viable. Sure, the label is explicit, and tells one
		everything one needs to know about the sample, but one can't physically
		order a bunch of samples with labels of that form, which means the
		physical sample cannot be found quickly, nor worked with conveniently in
		electronic form. Also, it can be very difficult to tell 'Blood Sample
		Joe Blogs 2008-03-14 Stage 3 infection' apart from 'Blood Sample Joe
		Blogs 2008-03-18 Stage 3 infection', or 'Blood Sample Joe Blags
		2008-03-14 Stage 3 infection'.</p>

		<p>Thus we introduce the case for the <strong>unique
		identifier</strong>. A unique identifier need bear no semantic relation
		to the thing it identifies. It is just a number, usually, and can always
		be mapped to a number. This gives one two distinct advantages:</p>

		<ul>

			<li><strong>Uniqueness:</strong> every structured item of data, i.e.
			record, is identifiably different from every other, even if all the structured
			information it contains, i.e. the fields, is identical.</li>

			<li><strong>Relative Order:</strong> structured data items can be
			ordered and referenced regardless of data type(s).</li>

		</ul>

		<p>To such a unique identifier, we can attach additional attributes or
		information, which brings us back to the concept of records (now
		indexed by a unique identifier) and fields.</p>

		<h2>The Relational Database Model: Tables and Columns</h2>

		<p>The relational database model deals with abstract data management
		and storage. Most of the abstraction involves changing terminology so
		it doesn't sound like every other database model. A relational database
		consists of one or more <strong>tables</strong> (more formally known as
		<strong>relations</strong>). Each table has <strong>rows</strong>
		(records, or formally <strong>tuples</strong>), and each row in a given
		table has identical <strong>columns</strong> (fields, or formally
		<strong>attributes</strong>) to all other rows in the same table. So we
		have something that looks like a spreadsheet, but with some important
		differences. In a spreadsheet one row may use more or less columns than
		another, whereas a relational database table does not allow this. Also,
		all columns in a table have a type, e.g.  text, integer, float, etc...
		This is a property of the column as a whole, not a field in an
		individual row, meaning all data values stored in a particular column
		in a particular table are of the same type.</p>

		<p>Consider the case of a medical trial. The trials need to keep
		records of the patients involved, the medications administered, the
		date of administrations, contact details, and their states of health at
		various time points. For the moment we'll just look at the patients
		themselves.</p>

		<table cellspacing='0'>
			<caption>The 'Patient' Table</caption>
			<thead>
				<tr>

		</table>

		<p>Examining the table above, we can observe a number of things.
		Firstly, there is a unique identifier, namely the 'patient_id'. The
		patient themselves may never know this number, but it allows the
		database system to distinguish between two different Alice C. Smith's,
		if the case were to arise.</p>

		<h2>Primary Keys</h2>

		<p>Each table in a relational database can have a primary key. The
		primary key is always unique amongst the rows of the table, and is thus
		a unique identifier. It is usually a number, but can be any sortable
		type. It can consists of multiple columns too, but we'll get to that
		later. Depending on the database software being used, primary keys that
		are of numeric type can be automatically generated as new rows are
		created, leaving the hassle of determining a new unique primary key for a
		row up to the database software and not the programmer. Methods for
		doing this are implementation specific. In our example above we would
		choose 'patient_id' as our primary key for the table.</p>

		<h2>Relationships Between Tables and Foreign Keys</h2>

		<p>Considering the information we want to store, the patient table is
		woefully inadequate. What about their state of health, or their
		medication records? Well, we could add columns to the patient table, for
		example a column named 'medication_date', and another, 'dosage'. But
		this would be the wrong approach. We would either limit ourselves to
		exactly one administration of medication, or alternatively duplicate
		data, and end up with diverging information about the 'same' record.</p>

		<p>Let's consider the first option. If we wanted to store multiple
		administration events, we would have to add columns to some rows, as
		those events happened, leaving other rows alone. But this violates the
		principle that all rows in a table have exactly the same columns. No
		dice! If we extended the entire table, we would have a number of rows
		with missing data &mdash; less of a problem &mdash; but also not
		desirable.</p>

		<p>The second option is to make each row its own administration event.
		So every time Barry Black gets dosed, he gets a row in the table, with
		the additional columns 'dosage' and 'medication_date'. Two rows means
		he's been dosed twice, three rows, thrice, etc... The problem here is
		that each time we create a new row for Barry, there's a chance for human
		error. Barry Black might have been dosed three times, but the system
		reflects only twice, while the mysterious Barry Block has also been
		dosed (according to the system), but no one knows who he is.</p>

		<p>The solution, of course, is to create another table. Let's call it
		'Dose'. It records the date of a dose, an arbitrary unique id for the
		dose (for example a vial bar code), the dosage amount, and of course to
		whom the dose was given.</p>

		<table cellspacing='0'>
			<caption>The 'Dose' Table</caption>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>dose_id</th>
					<th>date</th>
					<th>amount</th>
					<th>patient</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>integer</th>
					<th>date</th>
					<th>float</th>
					<th>integer (Patient)</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>

			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>2008/08/02</td>
					<td>3.2</td>
					<td>2</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>2</td>
					<td>2008/08/02</td>
					<td>3.2</td>
					<td>1</td>

					<td>3</td>
					<td>2008/08/02</td>
					<td>3.2</td>

			</tbody>
		</table>

		<p>So we see from this table that everyone arrived on 2008/08/02 for
		their initial dose, but that so far only Barry Black has arrived for his
		second dose, 10 days later, and that the second dose is less than the
		first (presumably to suit the purposes of the trial).</p>

		<p>The biggest concept to grasp here is that of the <strong>foreign
		key</strong>. Note the fourth column, 'patient', has type integer, and
		is 'tagged' as pointing to the Patient table. In relational database
		terms such a column is called a foreign key, and this implies a number
		of things:</p>

		<ul>

			<li>Any value stored in a foreign key column, must exist as a value
			in the primary key column of the table specified as the foreign
			table, in our case 'Patient'. Implicitly this means only one foreign
			row can be indicated, since primary keys must be unique.</li>

			<li>The row in the foreign table ('Patient') with the primary key
			equal to the value of the foreign key column in the local table
			('Dose') can be linked, or rather <strong>joined</strong> to the
			local row.</li>

			<li>The values in a foreign key column need not be unique, e.g. Barry
			Black can have multiple doses administered.</li>

			<li>By the way, there is no limit to the number of different columns
			in a table which can be foreign keys. Nor must a foreign key always
			point into a different table. Consider the example of representing
			genetic lineage. In the organism table, each row records its mother
			and father, assuming an organism the reproduces sexually. Both
			mother and father are organisms too, and have all the rights of
			organisms accorded to them. So we need two foreign keys, mother and
			father, which point to another row in the same table ('organism').
			In the case of an original organism, i.e. the first of its kind, we
			might want to leave mother and father as NULL. In fact this is most
			likely the case, since we are at some point not going to know the
			lineage of a particular organism unless we are able to catalogue the
			entire species.</li>

		</ul>

		<p>Foreign keys and the separation of data into various tables provide
		us with a number of pros over the other two possible methods suggested
		before. Firstly, when we create a new row in Dose, we simply 'link' it
		to the appropriate patient, meaning there's far less chance of human
		error. In fact the only human error that can occur is that a dose may be
		linked to the wrong patient, or perhaps have the amount or date recorded
		incorrectly. Secondly, the number of columns in both tables remains the
		same, both for every row in each table respectively, and for each table
		over time. We don't have to change the structure of our data.</p>

		<p>Using foreign keys and an appropriate structure for our data, we can
		answer a number of questions simply and quickly, for example:</p>

		<ol>

			<li>How many doses has patient X received? (count number of rows in
			'Dose' where patient = X)</li>

			<li>If, for example, every even numbered dose is a placebo, then
			which patients received placebos? (list rows from Patient where
			patient_id = Dose.patient and dose_id is even)</li>

			<li>How may doses were given out between specified dates?</li>

			<li>On what dates did patient X receive their doses?</li>

		</ol>

		<h2>Joining Tables to Query Data</h2>

		<p>If we look at question 2 immediately above, we see something a little
		strange, namely the comparison of a value in a single row (patient_id)
		to all the values in a particular column of an entire table
		(Dose.patient). Well, that's what it looks like because of the way we
		phrased the question, but in actual fact particular rows in Dose are
		chosen for comparison implicitly. Technically, what happens is a
		<strong>join</strong>ing of the two tables on certain conditions, in
		this case the condition that Patient.patient_id = Dose.patient.</p>

		<p>A join involves the implicit creation of a temporary table, with 
		columns from both source tables, and rows filled out with data from the
		rows of the source tables that match specified conditions. This is best
		explained by example.</p>

		<p>Rephrasing question 2, let's display all rows from Dose where the
		dose_id is even (i.e. they're placebo doses) and append the information
		from the Patient table of the patient whose patient_id matches the
		value in the patient column of each found row from dose. Now, reading
		from left to right, we first get rows 2 and 4 from Dose. Let's put these
		rows into a new table called 'Result'.</p>
		
		<table cellspacing='0'>
			<caption>The 'Result' Table</caption>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>dose_id</th>
					<th>date</th>
					<th>amount</th>
					<th>patient</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>integer</th>
					<th>date</th>
					<th>float</th>
					<th>integer (Patient)</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>

			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>2</td>
					<td>2008/08/02</td>
					<td>3.2</td>
					<td>1</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>4</td>
					<td>2008/08/12</td>
					<td>2.5</td>
					<td>2</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>

		<p>Continuing, we want to append information from the Patient Table. For
		the moment we are only interested in names. So let's add the column's to
		'Result'.</p>
		
		<table cellspacing='0'>
			<caption>The new 'Result' Table</caption>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>dose_id</th>
					<th>date</th>
					<th>amount</th>
					<th>patient</th>
					<th>firstname</th>
					<th>surname</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>integer</th>
					<th>date</th>
					<th>float</th>
					<th>integer (Patient)</th>
					<th>char(64)</th>
					<th>char(64)</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>

			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>2</td>
					<td>2008/08/02</td>
					<td>3.2</td>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>NULL</td>
					<td>NULL</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>4</td>
					<td>2008/08/12</td>
					<td>2.5</td>
					<td>2</td>
					<td>NULL</td>
					<td>NULL</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>

		<p>Now that we have added the columns, we need to fill them with the
		correct data, replacing the NULLs. Relational databases all have a
		special value 'NULL' which is similar to None in python. It is typeless,
		and as such any column can have NULL values regardless of its type. You can
		specify the NULL values are not allowed in certain columns, and this is
		implicit in some cases, e.g. primary keys cannot be NULL. Technically,
		the NULL values are never created during an actual join, and are visible
		here only for illustrative purposes.</p>

		<p>We need to fill in the NULLs with the information from rows from the
		Patient table whose patient_id matches the value of the column 'patient'
		in the row we are trying to fill in. So, for the first row's NULLs we
		take the first name and surname from row 1 of Patient, i.e. Alice Smith.
		Similarly, for the second row of the Result table, we fill in 'Barry' and
		'Black'.</p>

		<table cellspacing='0'>
			<caption>The final 'Result' Table</caption>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>dose_id</th>
					<th>date</th>
					<th>amount</th>
					<th>patient</th>
					<th>firstname</th>
					<th>surname</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>integer</th>
					<th>date</th>
					<th>float</th>
					<th>integer (Patient)</th>
					<th>char(64)</th>
					<th>char(64)</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>

			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>2</td>
					<td>2008/08/02</td>
					<td>3.2</td>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>Alice</td>
					<td>Smith</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>4</td>
					<td>2008/08/12</td>
					<td>2.5</td>
					<td>2</td>
					<td>Barry</td>
					<td>Black</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>

		<p>You might be surprised at some point by what looks like the creation
		of extra rows out of nowhere when performing a join, or rather, you
		might get more rows than you expect. For example, what if one wanted to
		see the information about Barry Black, and his dosage history. We might
		expect one row, since we're only interested in one patient. But Barry
		has been dosed twice. The complete joined result table would look like
		this:</p>

		<table cellspacing='0'>

			<thead>
				<tr>

					<th>char(64)</th>

					<th>char(12)</th>

					<th>float</th>

				</tr>
			</thead>

			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>2</td>
					<td>Black</td>
					<td>Barry</td>
					<td>J</td>
					<td>0239876543</td>
					<td>42 Enigma Lane, Illford, 5017</td>

				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>

		<p>Clearly, there are two rows for one patient. The alternative would be
		to have one row with a variable number of columns, but this presents
		problems. Firstly, we might have multiple columns with the same names,
		and no way to tell which columns should be grouped together, e.g. which
		dose id belongs to which date. Also, it is programatically simpler to
		deal with multiple rows with a consistent number of columns, than the
		opposite. In addition, the above example highlights some important
		points about joining tables:</p>

		<ul>

			<li>Column types are transfered during joins.</li>

			<li>Primary keys, foreign keys, and other uniqueness constraints are
			not transferred.</li>

			<li>Resultant tables have no primary key!</li>

		</ul>

		<h2>Cardinality of Relationships</h2>

		<p>When designing our data structure and choosing which tables we will
		use, what they will contain, and how they will be linked, it is
		important to understand how the information in various tables is
		related. While this is often obvious in a particular case, more
		abstractly there are only three possible types of relationships that can
		exist between any two given tables, and relational databases can only
		really represent two of these.</p>

		<dl>

			<dt>One-to-one:</dt>

			<dd>One row in Table A is linked to at most one row in Table B.
			This is represented using a foreign key in Table B that points to
			the primary key of Table A, and has a uniqueness constraint placed
			on the foreign key in Table B. The foreign key may allow NULL
			values, or may not. This type of relationship is most often used to
			represent some form of class inheritance of attributes, e.g. Given
			three tables to record information about staff, namely Staff,
			Doctors, Nurses. We want to store the same basic information about
			both nurses and doctors, but for each type there are profession
			specific details as well. Both the doctors and nurses table link to
			staff in a one-to-one manner, as a staff member cannot exist twice,
			but the doctors and nurses tables respectively store the profession
			specific information required.</dd>

			<dt>One-to-Many</dt>

			<dd>One row in Table A is linked to potentially multiple rows in
			Table B. This is represented using a foreign key in Table B that
			points to the primary key of Table A, with no uniqueness constraint.
			Again NULL values for the foreign key may or may not be allowed on a
			case by case basis. Our previous example of dosage and patients is a
			one-to-many relationship.</dd>

			<dt>Many-to-Many</dt>

			<dd>Potentially multiple rows in Table A are linked to potentially
			multiple rows in Table B. Continuing with the medical theme of
			examples, a doctor treats many patients, represented by a foreign
			key in the Patient table to the primary key of the Doctor Table.
			However, a single patient may be treated by many doctors over the
			long term.</dd>

		</dl>

		<p>The many-to-many case cannot be directly represented in a relational
		databases. If we put the foreign key in the Doctor table, that means
		patients doctors can only treat one patient, without using a dynamic
		number of columns in a table; an idea which we've hopefully left behind
		to rot on the wayside. Similarly, putting the foreign key in the Patient
		table means a patient can be treated by only one doctor.</p>

		<p>The solution is to create a third intermediate table, often called a
		<strong>link table</strong>. In this table we have two foreign keys. One
		to doctor, and one to patient. The presence of a row in the link table
		pointing to some doctor D and some patient P, means that patient P has
		been treated by doctor D. Should D treat another patient Q, we simply
		add a row to the link table (D:Q). Similarly, should patient P be
		treated by a second doctor (E), we add a row (E:P) to the link
		table. Because both the doctor and patient columns in the link table are
		foreign keys, the same doctor can appear multiple times, and the same
		patient can appear multiple times.</p>

		<p>In fact, we can store additional information in link tables. We
		might, for instance, want to store the dates of treatments. In this case
		the link table would have the two foreign key columns and a date column.
		But now what if a patient is treated by the same doctor multiple times.
		No problem. Create another row with the same doctor/patient pairing, and
		a different date. It is useful in this case to create an additional
		column to act as primary key for the link table.</p>

		<p>There are also times when we might want to indicate only that two
		item are linked in some way. An artist may record multiple songs, and
		similarly a song may be performed by multiple artists in a single
		recording. We are not interested in how many times a particular artist
		performed a song though. So we would have the three tables Artist, Song,
		and PerformedBy. PerformedBy would have only two columns, artist (a
		foreign key) and song (another foreign key). We want to ensure that we
		don't record more than once the fact that some artist A has performed
		the song S. We could make either of the two foreign keys a primary key
		as well, but that causes problems. If we make artist the primary key,
		the we can only record one song performance for any given artist.
		Instead, we can make the primary key consist of both columns in the
		table. This means the we can have many rows with the same artist, as
		long as each row has a different song as the other foreign key.
		Likewise, each sing can appear multiple times as long as each artist
		paired with it is unique. This combination means we never record the
		fact that an artist has performed a song more than once.</p>

		<h2>Normalisation</h2>

		<p>As always, real life intrudes rudely on the ideals on computational
		theory. The fact of the matter is that databases change. Not only their
		contents change, we expect that, and that's what they're designed to
		deal with anyway. But over time, we might require that their structures
		be modified to. Due to some change in the law we might suddenly need to
		keep additional business records about certain types of transactions,
		for example. Since the inception of relational databases though, we have
		also had the concept of <strong>normalisation</strong>, which is a
		method to reduce to work involved in making structural changes to
		database.</p>

		<p>If we explore the example of a law being changed or introduced
		requiring additional record keeping, we can quickly tell how difficult
		it becomes to modify database structure once data already exists. We
		have a very simple database originally, with only one table, which
		records the sale of products: product name, price, and time of sale.
		Sometimes, the additional information we need to record can be added
		simply. Tax amount? We can simply add a column that records the taxable
		amount of the sale. But what if the problem is more complex. Suppose we
		run a hardware store selling some products that are regulated by the
		government, e.g. detonators for industrial explosives. Currently we are
		required to keep a record of to whom the sale of such an item was made,
		and we record it in a column in the sales table. Now, the law changes,
		and retailers are required not only to record to whom the sale is made,
		but also to limit the number of detonators a single customer may buy to
		one per day. Now we're stuck. We can't make the purchaser field unique,
		because that would mean a particular customer could only but a detonator
		once, and never again. Also, what about the other products they might
		want to buy? What we need to do is now separate the purchasers out into
		their own table, and instead use a link table where we can specify a
		primary key over the columns: purchaser, sale, and date. Rows are only
		added to the link table for detonator purchases. Now the same person
		trying to purchase multiple detonators on the same date will be
		disallowed by the database system. Perfect solution, but it requires
		some fairly extensive restructuring of the actual database structure,
		the creation of new tables, the removal of columns from one table and
		their inclusion into another, and all this without losing any data,
		either directly, or implicit, like the fact that the purchaser being
		moved came originally from the sale with id X on date Y.</p>

		<p>Now that we understand the nastiness of getting things wrong, how do
		we get them right. Enter, the <strong>normal forms</strong>. The normal
		forms are each a collection of criteria for your database structure,
		that if fulfilled will generally ensure that structural changes are
		restricted to additions instead of deletions, or worse rearrangements
		and movements. Followed stepwise and in order, and applied to every
		table, they are as follows:</p>

		<h3>The First Normal Form</h3>

		<ol>
			
			<li>Each row is unique, i.e. no two rows in a table are entirely
			identical. Easily done by making sure every table has a primary
			key.</li>

			<li>All columns in a table consist of value of consistent
			type/kind. Normally taken care of database software enforcing typing

		<h3>Further Reading</h3>

		<p>For a way more in depth technical discussion on the normal forms
		(there are more than 3, but only the first three are generally
		important, no matter what your local database systems lecturer
		insists), take a look at the <a
		href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization'>the
		wikipedia entry</a> on database normalisation.</p>

		<h2>The Client/Server Model</h2>

		<p>Most relational database software is implemented using a
		client/server model, where the database software runs as a server, and
		accepts connections on which the client can send instructions to either
		examine or modify the contents of the database. This approach has a
		number of advantages:</p>

		<ul>

			<li>The complexity of managing a relation database, and all the
			other features provided (backup services, multiple concurrent users,
			transaction processing, security and access control, etc...) need
			not be present in every piece of client software.</li>

			<li>A crash on the client machine won't corrupt the database on the
			server.</li>

			<li>Remote connection over network or even the Internet.</li>

			<li>Multiple users or programs, or most often instances
			of a program, can access the database server concurrently, allowing
			for the creation of standardised distributed applications, e.g.
			Point of Sale Terminals, Airline ticketing and check in systems,
			etc...</li>

		</ul>

		<p>What this means to us as budding Python programmers is that in order
		to use a relational database, which is presently the industry standard
		model for databases, we need to have a relational database server
		installed where we can reasonably access one. For the remainder of this
		course we're going to use PostgreSQL as our example software, just
		because the author of these notes happens to like it better. Where
		possible, i.e. where the author can actually remember them, MySQL syntax
		differences will be noted. MySQL is the most widely adopted open source
		relational database server software, but PostgreSQL is the better for
		educational purposes and general standards compliance, plus it actually
		implements cool stuff like triggers, and implicit constraints, and
		rules, ooh and ...</p>

		<p>It is beyond the scope of this material... blah blah blah. We're not
		going to cover installation of a database server because it tends to be
		an arcane black art that is highly distribution and OS dependant. Get
		you're local IT guru to help you out, have pizza and beer on hand for
		payment.</p>
