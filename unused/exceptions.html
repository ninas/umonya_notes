		<h2>The Nature of Errors</h2>

		<p>In an ideal world there would be no errors. As programmers we are
		lazy, smart, and for some reason, despite copious amounts of blatant
		evidence to the contrary, idealistic. We like to believe that errors
		are unusual. We consider them <strong>exceptional</strong>. Something
		out of the ordinary. Hence the term <a class='doclink'
		href='http://docs.python.org/lib/module-exceptions.html'>exception</a>
		was coined. An exception is an error, but it's more than that. When an
		error occurs we want to know why it occurred, and what the error is. If
		errors were simply errors, each one would be different, and we would
		have to deal with each one individually, when it was encountered. But
		we realise quickly that errors can be partitioned into groups. Some
		errors are related to input/output, others to mathematical violations,
		yet others to syntax violations etc... So we start thinking classes.
		Let's put our errors into classes, and handle classes of errors. Let's
		also call errors exceptions for the sake of optimism. So exceptions are
		classes of errors. Exceptions can thus be derived from parent classes.
		This means we can deal only with a higher level class such as 'all I/O
		exceptions' or with a specific class of exception ('file not found') as
		and when we see fit. We can also create our own specialised exceptions,
		by creating a class derived from another exception. The base exception
		class is, surprisingly, called 'Exception'.</p>

		<h2>Catching Exceptions with the try Statement</h2>

		<p>Great! So now we have this wonderful hierarchy of exceptions. What
		do we do with them? When things go wrong in our program, exceptions are
		<strong>thrown</strong>. The exception is thrown outwards in terms of
		scope. At each level of scope, it can be <strong>caught</strong>. If an
		exception is uncaught by the time it hits the global scope, python
		catches it. But python does nasty things when it catches exceptions. It
		prints out tracebacks and stops running our program. So we want to
		catch errors before they get to the global scope. To do this we use the
		try statement.</p>

		<pre class='definition'>
try:
    &lt;statement&gt;
    [statement]
    [...]
except [varname] [exception class]:
    &lt;statement&gt;
    [statement]
    [...]
[except [varname] [exception class]:
    &lt;statement&gt;
    [statement]
    [...]]
</pre>

		<p>Each statement in a try block is executed in order, as normal. If
		any exceptions are thrown, execution immediately jumps to the beginning
		of the first except block with a matching exception class. So if the
		exception thrown is an ArithmeticError, execution jumps to the
		<code>except&nbsp;ArithmeticError:</code> block. If there is a division
		by zero exception, which is a subclass of ArithmeticError, and there is
		an <code>except&nbsp;ZeroDivisionError:</code> clause before the
		ArithmeticError clause, execution will jump there. Once execution has
		reached an except clause, the exception in considered caught, and won't
		continue outwards to the global scope. Of course, if in our handling of
		the exception in the except clause, we throw another exception, then we
		must catch that too, or have python get rude on us.</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
#a small program to demonstrate exception handling

import math

try:
   print 3.2/0.0
except ZeroDivisionError:
   print "Division by Zero!"
except ArithmeticError:
   print "We'll never get here because ZeroDivisionError is a subclass of ArithmeticError"
</pre>

		<pre class='listing'>
#a small program to demonstrate exception handling

import math

try:
   print math.sqrt(-1)
except ZeroDivisionError:
   print "Division by Zero! But sqrt(-1) isn't this kind of error, so we'll skip this."
except ValueError:
   print "Use a complex number instead!"
</pre>

		<p>Note how we can have multiple except clauses for a single 'try
		statement'. And also note how the order of exceptions of the same
		(super)class need to be ordered correctly. Finally, we can just have a
		classless except clause after all our other except clauses
		(<code>except:</code>), which will catch <strong>any and every
		exception</strong> that falls through to it.</p>

		<h2>Cleaning up with finally</h2>

		<p>Sometimes, we want to do something regardless of whether an
		exception was encountered or not. For example, we have a section of
		code that opens a file and parses it. If during parsing we encounter an
		exception, we must close the file. But we need to close the file even
		if parsing was successful. A single 'finally clause' can be placed
		after all 'except clauses' in a try statement. The code of the finally
		clause is executed after all of the main clauses code and any except
		clause code that needs to be executed. Note that the finally clause can
		only be used in conjuntion with an except clause from python 2.5
		onwards. Before python 2.5 try statements can have either an except
		clause or a finally clause, not both.</p>

		<h2>Throwing Our Own Tantrums</h2>

		<p>The last bit about exceptions, is how to be objectionable, err...
		exceptional, ourselves. When we are writing code to put into a module,
		for later use, we often wish to throw our own exceptions when we find
		strange conditions, to alert whoever else is using our code to a
		problem. We can do so using the raise statement.</p>

		<pre class='definition'>
raise &lt;exception object&gt;
</pre>

		<p>Note that the raise statement takes an <strong>object</strong>, not
		a class, so we must instantiate an object of the chosen exception
		class. For example, in a vector classes vector addition method, we
		might want to raise an exception if the second vector is not of the
		same length as the first. We would raise a ValueError (the second
		vector doesn't have an appropriate value) and we do so using</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
raise ValueError("Vector's must be of the same length for addition")
</pre>

		<p>Above we see two things. First the use of round brackets to 'call
		the class', or rather create an object of that class. Secondly, we see
		a feature of all exception classes constructors, namely the ability to
		create an exception object with a specific error message. Python will
		display this error message at the end of the traceback if the exception
		remains uncaught.</p>

		<h2>A Monolithic Example in the Form of a FastA Parser</h2>

		<pre class='listing'>
<b>#This is a module that provides a FastA file parser. It serves to demonstrate the
#use of exceptions using try, except, raise, and finally</b>

<strong>class ParseError(Exception): #Create a new class of exception
    pass</strong>

def getFastARecord(f):
    <b>"""Retrieves the next FastA record from the already opened file f. 
       Return a tuple (sequence title, sequence string) 
       or None if at end of file. Raises a ParseError"""</b>
    line = f.readline()
    while line.isspace() and line != '':
        line = f.readline()
    if line == '':
        return None
    if not line.startswith('&gt;'):
        <strong>raise ParseError("Expected '&gt;' at start of next sequence record. "+
        "Is this a FastA file?")</strong>
    title = line[1:-1]
    seq = ""
    line = f.readline()

    <b>#this uses the strict format of a fasta file which requires at least 
    #one empty line between records</b>
    while (not line.isspace()) and (line != ''): 
        seq += line.rstrip()
        line = f.readline()
    return (title, seq)

def getAllFastARecords(path):
    <b>"""Attempts to open the file path, the returns a list of all FastA records in the file 
       as tuples of the form (title, sequence string)."""</b>

    <strong>try:</strong>
        f = open(path, "r");
    <strong>except IOError:</strong> 
        <b>#here we catch an IOError 
        #(i.e. the file doesn't exist, can't be opened, is corrupt, 
        #we don't have permissions etc...)</b>
        return None

    <b>#from here we know f has been successfully opened, so it must be closed</b>
    <strong>try:</strong>
        records = []
        rec = getFastARecord(f)
        while rec != None:
            records.append(rec)
            rec = getFastARecord(f)
    <strong>except ParseError:</strong> <b>#if there is a parse error return no records</b>
        return None
    <strong>finally:</strong>
        f.close()

    return records
</pre>
