		<h2>Traceback most recent WHAT???</h2>

		<p>We are by now all familiar with the dreaded <code>Traceback (most
		recent call last):</code>. The sign that something has gone wrong, that
		your late night just got later, your assignment is rapidly becoming
		overdue, and that there's not nearly enough coffee left in the jug!
		Well, believe it or not, the messages Python prints are there to help
		you, as long as you are willing to read and understand them.</p>

		<h2>The Call Stack</h2>

		<p>First we need to understand the concept of the <em>call stack</em>. When we
		are running our Python program, the execution point moves around, from
		top to bottom, branching at if statements, looping with while or for
		statements, or jumping inside functions...  but this causes issues. If
		an error occurs in our main program block, it is easy to find the problem by 
                looking at the line on which the error occurred. There is generally only one way for
		execution to reach that line. But in a function, which can be called
		from many places within our program, including itself or other
		functions, knowing that the error occurred on a line in a particular
		function definition doesn't help us understand how the flow of
		execution led up to the error.</p>

                <p>Enter the <em>call stack</em>! Every time a
		function is called, Python pushes it on to something called the <em>call
		stack</em>. Think of a stack like getting into the elevator in a crowded
		mall. You get in first, and as more people enter the elevator, you are
		forced to the back. When you arrive at your floor, the last person in,
		now being closest to the door, exits first. If you want to get out in
		the middle somewhere, everyone who got in after you must briefly step
		out, to let you out, then go back in. This is exactly what happens with
		the <em>call stack</em>. As functions are called, their names are placed on the
		stack, and as they return, their names are removed.</p>

                <p>The <em>traceback</em> presents us with the list of called function, from the first called to
		the most recent called (<code>most recent call last</code>). It gives us the following information:
                <ul>
                    <li>the file where the call occurred,</li>
                    <li>the line in that file,</li>
                    <li>the name of the function the call was made from (or '?' if it isn't a function), and</li>
                    <li>the line where the next function was called, or where the error occurred.</li>
                </ul>
                So let's go through the following traceback:</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 25, in ?
    triangle()
  File "test.py", line 12, in triangle
    inc_total_height()
  File "test.py", line 8, in inc_total_height
    total_height = total_height + height
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'total_height' referenced before assignment
</pre>

		<p>We see that execution started in the file test.py and proceeded to
		line 25, where the function 'triangle' was called. Within the function
		triangle, execution proceeded until line 12, where the function
		'inc_total_height' was called. Within 'inc_total_height' and error
		occurred on line 8.</p>

		<h2>The Nature of The Problem</h2>

		<p>The last line, or sometimes two lines, of the traceback describe
		what actually went wrong. In Python, all errors are given a class, e.g.
		input/output error, undefined variable or index out of range.
		These classes are given names that are one word without spaces. 
                The class name of the error describes roughly what type of
		error occurred and it is printed first. Then everything following the
		colon (':') is further description of the actual variables,
		expressions, and statements involved in the error, and what they were
		doing. So we can tell from the above example that the class was
		'UnboundLocalError' and that the local variable 'total_height' was
		referenced, or evaluated, before a value was assigned to it.</p>

		<p>Learning the meaning of the class names comes with time, but the
		description following is usually sufficient to point you in the right
		direction. At least now you can track down exactly what line is causing
		the problem, and how the program got there.</p>
