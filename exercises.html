			numbers.</li>

			<li>Write a program that asks the user to enter a sequence of
			numbers, ending with a blank line. Print out the average of those
			numbers.</li>

			<li>Modify your solution to exercise 36 so that instead of printing
			the average and then terminating when a blank line is entered, it
			prints the average and then asks if the user wants to repeat the
			process. If the user answers 'y' the process is repeated, otherwise
			the program terminates.</li>

		</ol>

		<h3>Lesson 8</h3> <!-- sequential loops -->

		<ol start='38'>

			<li>Write a program that asks the user for the height of a triangle.
			If a blank line is entered, the program finishes, otherwise it

			bottom right, made of asterisks ('*') of a height equal to the
			number entered. Example input/output follows ...

				<pre class='listing'>
Enter triangle height: 3

			their sequence entry by providing a blank line for the x
			coordinate. Then display a five by five grid of '#' characters,
			with the points in the grid entered by the user left blank. Assume
			x increases from left to right, and y increases from top to bottom.
			Example input/output is given ...
				
				<pre class='listing'>Coordinates range from 0 to 4!
Please enter pair of coordinates (x:y), leave x blank to terminate sequence.

		<h3>Lesson 10</h3> <!-- tuples -->

		<ol start='41'>

			<li>

				Write a function that returns the sum of two vectors, where the
				sum of two vectors is a vector of the same dimension (i.e. has
				the same number of elements) as both the original vectors (i.e.
				original vectors must be of equal dimension, otherwise return
				None), and has each element equal to the sum of its respective
				elements from the original two vectors.<br />
				<br />
				<code>[x, y, z] + [a, b, c] = [x+a, y+b, z+c]</code><br />
				<br />
				Then ask the user to enter the direction and speed (in the form
				of a 2 dimensional vector) of the wind, and again of an object
				travelling in a two dimensional space. Your program should
				output the vector representing the resultant direction vector of
				the object.<br />

		<ol start="42">

			<li>A small arts and crafts store owner in the middle of the Karoo
			has recently upgraded to a computerised point of sale system, and
			wants to do the same for his guest book. Customers have previously
			left their names a small paragraph of comment in the book. The owner
			would like his customers to be able to walk up to a computer near
			the exit, type in their names, and enter a brief comment. He's only
			interested in a customer's most recent comments, and doesn't want
			store old comments. So repeat customer's must be able to update
			their previous comments. When a repeat customer types in their name,
			their previous comment is displayed back to them, and they are
			afforded the opportunity to enter a new comment. Should they enter a
			blank line instead of a comment, their previous comment is
			preserved. Also, if instead of a customer name the special command
			'quit' is entered, the program exits. Similarly the command
			'showcomments' causes all customers' names to be displayed, followed
			by their comments slightly indented. Customer's must be able to
			enter their names in any case.</li>

			<li>Extend your solution to the previous problem, by allowing
			customers to enter multi-line comments, and to terminate their
			comments by entering a blank line. If the comment is entirely blank,
			i.e. the first line is blank, then it does not overwrite the former
			comment if any. Also, ensure that when the comments are outputted
			back, either because of the 'showcomments' command, or a repeat
			customer entering their name, that the line width of the outputted
			comments does not exceed 60 characters, nor break a word in two,
			i.e. lines are only broken on white space.</li>

		</ol>

		<h3>Lesson 12</h3>

		<ol start="43">

			<li>Write a program to display the contents of a file as is, i.e.
			the whitespace and line breaks outputted must be identical to that
			in the file. Ask the user which file to display.</li>

			<li>Write a program that asks the user for the name of a file, asks
			for the name of another file, then outputs the contents of the
			first file into the second file, essentially copying it.</li>

			<li>Convert the previous program into a function, and allow the
			user to continue entering filenames for source and destination
			files, until they enter a blank line for the source file.</li>

			<li>Instead of copying a file as is, write a new function that
			converts all letters in the source file to upper case letters when
			written to the destination file.</li>

			<li>Write a program that reads in a FastA file of the user's
			choice, and outputs a list of the 'titles' contained therein. You
			can obtain a sample FastA file <a
			href='data/brca.fasta'>here</a>.</li>

			<li>Write a program that reads in a FastA file of the user's
			choice, and outputs a numbered list of the titles contained
			therein. Ask the user for a number from the menu, make sure that
			the number is in range, otherwise ask again.  Display the title and
			sequence string of the sequence chosen by the user, then display
			the menu again. The user may quit the program by entering 'q' at
			the menu prompt.</li>

			<li>Write a program that reads in a grid of biomass densities (specified as floats) from a file designated by the user. The grid can be of any dimensions, as long as it is square, and is specified in the file by a number of <strong>
				tab separated</strong> floating point numbers, where tabs indicate column separation, and lines indicate row separation. Ask the user to input a number of hours. Each hour the biomass density in each cell of the grid increases by 5%. Biomass
				densities may not be greater than 1, and excess biomass density is spread evenly amongst the four grid cells to the north, east, south, and west. If those cells are already at density 1 themselves, no growth takes place. The grid does not wrap
				around. After the number of hours specified have been calculated, output the grid as a collection of lines of floats indicating the new biomass levels per cell. Sample output might be

		<ol start="30">
			<li>Write a program that reads a file specified as the first argument on the command line, and outputs it to screen.</li>

			<li>Write a program that reads a file specified as the last argument on the command line. If any optional command line arguments are encountered prior to the filename, i.e. more than one command line argument is given, those
			arguments specify things to do to the output. If the argument '-b' is encountered, blank lines are not outputted. If the argument '-C' is encountered, the first non white space letter after a period is Capitalised. Any error conditions should be
			sent to stderr.</li>

			<li>Write a program that accepts as its first command line argument a width in columns, and as its second command line argument a filename. The contents of that file are outputted to screen using lines no longer than width, and not
			breaking any words in two.</li>

			<li>Write a program to output the CG/AT ratio of all sequences in a FastA file specified on the command line, such that their titles are outputted followed by their GC/AT ratio, one sequence per line. The CG/AT ratio of a sequence
			is defined as the sum of occurrences of 'C' and 'G' divided by the sum of occurrences of 'A' and 'T' within that sequence.</li>

			<li>Write a program that accepts a single FastA file from the command line and for each sequence in the file, outputs that sequence's title, followed by a sequence of indented lines, one for each coding region found in the sequence,
			containing the contents of the coding region. Coding regions subsequent to the first should be in the same reading frame. Coding regions start at start codons ('TAA', 'TAG', 'TGA'), and stop at stop codons ('TTG', 'CTG', 'ATG'). Any match of start
			and stop codons defines a coding region.</li>

			<li>Describe in a natural language what the regular expression <b>Jack Sprat could eat no (fat)|(hat)</b> matches.</li>

			<li>Describe in a natural language what the regular expression <b>His wife|girlfriend could eat no lean|bean</b> matches.</li>

			<li>Write down all the possible matches for the regular expression <b>All in all Jack's ((wife's)|(girlfriend's) )?dietician was pretty (un)?happy about the situation</b>.</li>

			<li>Write a regular expression that identifies an integer.</li>

			<li>Write a regular expression that identifies a float.</li>

			<li>Write a regular expression that identifies a coding region.</li>

			<li>Write a regular expression that identifies a line containing at least one word float pair, where the word and the float are separated by a comma and any amount of white space before or after the comma, and pairs are separated
			from one another in the same way. An example line would be "Height, 0.37 ,\tweight,13.2 ,width, 0.54"</li>

			<li>Write a program that counts the number of a given character (from the command line) in a given string (also from the command line) recursively.</li>

			<li>Write a program that outputs the reverse of a given string (from the command line), by using a recursive reverse function.</li>

			<li>Write a non recursive function to sort a list of ten integers generated randomly. Do not use the list.sort() method.</li>

			<li>Write a recursive sort function. <em>Hint:</em> Write a function that inserts an integer into the correct place in an already sorted list, using recursion. Use this in your sort function.</li>

			<li>Write a program that lists all the permutations of a string given on the command line.</li>

			<li>A transport company needs to buy five new vehicles for its operation. As they are a start up company, they are very concerned about cash, and would like to spend as little as possible to get the most out of their vehicles. They
			want to get as much carrying capacity for as little money as possible, and they cannot afford more than R1 million anyway. Vehicles have the properties: cost, and carrying capacity. Assuming we are supplied the list of vehicle models available from
			the command line, each model as an argument specified as '&lt;name&gt;:&lt;cost&gt;:&lt;capacity&gt;', write a program that outputs the optimal combination of five vehicles that give the highest capacity/cost ratio.</li>

		<p class="header"><a name="week6" id="week6">Week 6</a></p>

		<ol start="48">
			<li>Write a vector class for vectors of any size. The class must support vector addition (__sub__), vector subtraction (__sub__), scalar multiplication (__mul__ by integer/float), vector multiplication (__mul__ by vector), unary
			negation (__neg__), magnitude/distance (__abs__), scaled magnitude, and dot product operations.</li>

			<li>Write a matrix class for matrices of any size. The class must support matrix addition (__add__), matrix subtraction (__sub__), scalar multiplication (__mul__ by integer/float), matrix multiplication (__mul__ by matrix/vector),
