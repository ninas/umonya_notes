		<h2>Tuples as Immutable Lists</h2>

		<p>In many ways tuples and lists are very similar. In fact <a
		class="doclink"
		href="http://olympiad.cs.uct.ac.za/docs/python-docs-2.6/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq">tuples</a> are
		basically immutable lists, that is, lists which cannot be changed. All
		the same operators work on them: concatenation, repetition,
		subscription, and slicing. All the comparison operators work in the
		same way: equivalence, less than, greater than, 'is'. However,
		<strong>assignments to tuples cannot be made</strong> as they are
		immutable, or unchangeable.  Once a tuple has been formed, it cannot be
		changed. New tuples can be formed from others using concatenation,
		repetition, etc... but the operand tuples remain unchanged by the
		operators.</p>

		<h2>Forming a Tuple</h2>
		
		<p>Tuples are technically formed in python using a comma, although most
		often they are found recorded in round braces. Tuples can be of any
		length, and have their elements indexed from 0 to len(tuple)-1.</p>

		<h2>Using Tuples</h2>

		<p>Breaking it down we get to the old grind of operators, and in the
		case of tuples a few new ideas. Let's get the operators out of the
		way! If both 'a' and 'b' are tuples, 'v' is any expression, and 'i',
		'j', and 'k' are integers then</p>

		<ul>

			<li><code>a + b</code> yields Concatenation.</li>

			<li><code>a * i</code> yields Repetition.</li>

			<li><code>a[i]</code> yields Subscription, or the 'i'th element of
			'a'.</li>

			<li><code>a[i:j:k]</code> yields Slicing, or a copy of the list 'a'
			from its 'i'th element to its (j-1)'th element, taking only every
			'k'th element. If 'k' is omitted, every element in the range is
			taken.</li>

			<li><code>a[:i]</code> yields a slice from the beginning of the
			list to (i-1)'th element of 'a'.</li>

			<li><code>a[i:]</code> yields a slice from the 'i'th element to the
			end of the tuple.</li>

			<li><code>a[:]</code> yields a slice of the entire tuple.</li>

		</ul>

		<p>For completeness sake, here are examples ...</p>

		<p>The comparison of tuples to other tuples happens in the same way as
		lists to lists.</p>

		<ul>

			<li><code>a == b</code> yields Equivalence</li>

			<li><code>a &lt; b</code> yields Less Than. Note that tuples are
			compared in sequence order, meaning that 'a' is less then 'b' if
			'a's first element is less than 'b's first element. If 'a's first
			element and 'b's first element are equal, the second elements are
			checked, etc...</li>

			<li><code>v in a</code> is True only if the tuple 'a' contains an
			element whose value is that of the expression 'v'.</li>

			<li><code>a is b</code> is True only if 'a' and 'b' are the same
			tuple.</li>

		</ul>

		<p>If tuples have a subset of the functionality of lists, why ever use
		them? What can they do that lists cannot. Well, actually they provide a
		very convenient way to package multiple variables together for passing
		to a function as a parameter, or more likely returning from a function.
		Technically speaking functions can only return one value, but since a
		tuple is a single 'value' no matter how many elements it contains, a
		tuple could be used in a function that returns a two-component piece of
		data, for example an x:y coordinate. Even better, is that python
		<strong>implicitly unpacks tuples</strong>. By unpack we mean the
		assignment of multiple variables at once to their respective (based on
		position) elements in a tuple, for example</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; t = (1, 2, 3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a, b, c = t
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; c
3
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

		<p>And since tuples are formed by a comma, this provides us with a
		nifty little method to swap the values of two variables,</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; b, a = a, b
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
1
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

		<h2>Exercises</h2>

		<ol>

			<li>If the use of a comma forms a tuple, then how do we indicate a
			tuple as an expression to the print statement, rather than its
			elements as separate expressions?</li>

			<li>What is the difference between concatenation and addition of
			tuples? Why is the python plus operator for tuples a concatenation
			operator instead of an addition operator?</li>

			<li>The code <code>a, b = b, a</code> swaps the values of <em>a</em>
			and <em>b</em>. What would happen if added a third variable to the
			mix, <em>c</em>, as in <code>a, b, c = b, c, a</code>? What would
			happen if one repeated the statement indefinitely?</li>

			<li>Given a variable with the value of the empty tuple (<code>a =
			()</code>), how does one 'append' an element to 'a'?</li>

			<li>Write a program that accepts a list of numbers terminated by a
			blank line. Print out the entered numbers as elements of a tuple, in
			the order they were entered.</li>

			<li>Given a list of tuples each specifying a subject name and a
			grade symbol ('A' - 'F') in the form <code>[('Maths', 'D'),
			('Comp Sci', 'B'), ('English', 'C'), ('French', 'A'),
			('Science', 'B'), ('History', 'E')]</code>: <ol>

				<li>Write a program that prints out the subject with the highest
				mark.</li>

				<li>Write a program that outputs each subject and the grade
				symbol in the format 'subject: symbol', with each subject on a
				single line.</li>

				<li>Write a program that prints out a tab separated list of
				subjects on the first line, and the corresponding grades, also
				tab separated on the second line.</li>

			</ol></li>

			<li>Write a program that accepts a list of numbers terminated by a
			blank line, and stores the result in a tuple, <em>a</em>. Repeat the
			process to form a second user inputted tuple, <em>b</em>, making
			sure there are the same number of elements in <em>b</em> as in
			<em>a</em>. Print out the result of the <strong>mathematical
			addition</strong> (not concatenation) of the two tuples as a
			tuple.</li>
			
			<li>Write a program that reads a name and an age for a person, until
			the name is blank. As each name age pair is entered, store names in
			a list, and ages in another. Print a list of tuples of paired names
			and ages.</li>

			<li>Write a program that reads a name and an age for a person, until
			the name is blank. Once all names have been present the user with an
			option to list the entered people in alphabetical order, or in
			descending age order. For either choice, list each person's name
			followed by their age on a single line. Make sure you output the
			correct age for the correct person.</li>

			<!--
			<li>

				Write a function that returns the sum of two vectors, where the
				sum of two vectors is a vector of the same dimension (i.e. has
				the same number of elements) as both the original vectors (i.e.
				original vectors must be of equal dimension, otherwise return
				None), and has each element equal to the sum of its respective
				elements from the original two vectors.<br />
				<br />
				<code>[x, y, z] + [a, b, c] = [x+a, y+b, z+c]</code><br />
				<br />
				Then ask the user to enter the direction and speed (in the form
				of a 2 dimensional vector) of the wind, and again of an object
				travelling in a two dimensional space. Your program should
				output the vector representing the resultant direction vector of
				the object.<br />
