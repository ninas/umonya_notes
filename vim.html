		<h2>What is Vim?</h2>

		<p><a href="http://www.vim.org">Vim</a> is a text editor standard on
		nearly all *nix distributions. The only two distributions I know of
		that don't have Vim standard are gentoo and linux from scratch. Vim
		stands for 'vi improved' as Vim is based on the original visual (as
		opposed to line oriented) editor for unix, called 'vi'. Vi, and thus
		Vim, represent a fundamentally different way of editing files, as
		compared to the now more common methods employed by editors such as
		EMACS, Notepad, Kate, and pretty much every other editor out there. The
		difference lies in the fact that Vim operates in various 'modes',
		meaning different key strokes do different things at different times.
		This allows us to use only the standard alphanumeric and punctuation
		keys to perform all our tasks, because when we are not in insert mode,
		they can be used for something else. This is important, historically
		because keyboards used not be standardised beyond the alphanumeric and
		punctuation keys, and because even today, when remotely connected to
		another computer via telnet or ssh, there are only limited character
		sets (primarily employing only alphanumeric and punctuation characters)
		available on the connection protocol.</p>

		<p>It's important to realise that Vim is incredibly powerful, and really
		huge (in terms of learning quantity). I've been using it for eight
		years as my primary editor, and still find things I don't know about,
		and that I actually would start using daily. Never mind all the stuff in
		the help system I know I don't know about! This document serves only to
		introduce the very basics of Vim. If you want to know more, in general
		or about a specific command, and trust me, there's more to know, use
		Vim's help system.</p>

		<h2>Starting Vim?</h2>

		<p>We start Vim in a *nix environment simply by typing <code>vim</code>
		at the command prompt.</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
sirlark@hephaestus ~ $ vim
</pre>

		<p>Alternatively, we can choose a file to edit immediately, by
		specifying it as an argument on the command line</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
sirlark@hephaestus ~ $ vim myfile.txt
</pre>

		<p>We can in fact specify any number of filenames, and Vim will open
		them all, although only the first will be visible upon starting Vim.
		Files that already exist are loaded from disk into a
		<strong>buffer</strong> in Vim for editing. Buffers may not be visible,
		but are still in memory. Changes made to a buffer (changes you make to
		a file are in fact only made in memory) are only saved to disk when Vim
		is instructed to write the buffer. Filenames that do not exist create
		empty buffers, and the file itself is only created upon buffer
		write.</p>

		<h2>Command/Normal Mode</h2>

		<p>Vim starts in 'Command' (aka 'Normal' mode). In this mode keystrokes
		are <strong>not</strong> inserted into files, but rather they are used
		to issue large (or small) scale editing commands, such as cut, paste,
		delete line, jump to beginning of file, etc... Additionally, entering
		the character ':' allows us to type more complex commands on a Vim
		command line. A number of Vim commands use the concept of a motion.
		Simply put, a motion is a movement of the cursor from one point in the
		file to another. The motion is considered to be the contents of the
		file between the cursor's starting point and it's end point. The really
		important keystrokes you will need are</p>

		<ul>

			<li><code>w</code> moves to the beginning of the next word, where a
			word is considered an alphnumeric sequence of characters, i.e.
			punctuation breaks up words.</li>

			<li><code>W</code> moves to the beginning of the next word, where a
			word is considered an sequence of characters not broken by
			whitespace. Synonyms: <code>CTRL-Right</code></li>

			<li><code>e</code> moves to the next end of word
			(alphanumeric).</li>

			<li><code>E</code> moves to the next end of word (whitespace).</li>

			<li><code>r&lt;character&gt;</code> replaces the character under
			the cursor with the character entered.</li>

			<li><code>R</code> enters Insert Mode in overwrite or replace
			sub-mode.</li>

			<li><code>CTRL-R</code> redoes the last action undone by an undo
			comamnd.</li>

			<li><code>y&lt;motion&gt;</code> yanks (or copies) the motion for
			later pasting. If the motion is across multiple lines, all lines
			involved are copied in their entirety, linewise.</li>

			<li><code>yy</code> copies the entire contents of the current line,
			linewise.</li>

			<li><code>u</code> undoes the last action.</li>

			<li><code>i</code> enters Insert mode at the point in the file
			where the cursor is postioned. Synonyms: <code>INS</code></li>

			<li><code>o</code> enters Insert Mode by inserting a new blank line
			beneath the line the cursor is currently on. Upon entering insert
			mode, the cursor is positioned at the beginning of the newly
			inserted blank line.</li>

			<li><code>O</code> enters Insert Mode by inserting a new blank line
			above the line the cursor is currently on. Upon entering insert
			mode, the cursor is positioned at the beginning of the newly
			inserted blank line.</li>

			<li><code>p</code> pastes the most recently deleted or copied text
			at the position after the cursor. Linewise cuts and copies will
			always paste entire lines, splitting the current line to the right
			of cursor, and pasting complete lines between the two
			sections.</li>

			<li><code>p</code> pastes the most recently deleted or copied text
			before the character under the cursor. Linewise cuts and copies
			will always paste entire lines, splitting the current line at the
			character under the cursor, and pasting complete lines between the
			two sections.</li>

			<li><code>a</code> enters Insert mode just after the character
			under the cursor.</li>

			<li><code>A</code> enters Insert mode at the end of the current
			line.</li>

			<li><code>d&lt;motion&gt;</code> deletes from the cursor to the end
			of the motion specified. If the motion crosses multiple lines, all
			lines involved are deleted in their entirety, linewise. Deleted
			text is stored for later pasting.</li>

			<li><code>D</code> deletes from the cursor to the end of the
			current line. Deleted text is stored for later pasting.</li>

			<li><code>dd</code> deletes the current line linewise.</li>

			<li><code>gg</code> moves the cursor to the very beginning of the
			file.</li>

			<li><code>gq&lt;motion&gt;</code> formats the motion specified (use
			'ap' as a motion to indicate the entire paragraph, being a section
			of text from the last blank line to the next blank line) to fit the
			current maximum column width (usually 80, set with <code>:set
			tw=80</code>) obeying initial indentation according to the first
			line of the paragraph.</li>

			<li><code>G</code> moves the cursor to the first column on the last
			line of the file.</li>

			<li><code>h</code> moves the cursor one character to the left.
			Synonyms:<code>Left</code></li>

			<li><code>j</code> moves the cursor one line up.
			Synonyms:<code>Up</code></li>

			<li><code>J</code> joins the line after that which the cursor is on
			to the end of the current line, stripping any of the precedeing
			white space on the lower line.</li>

			<li><code>k</code> moves the cursor one line down.
			Synonyms:<code>Down</code></li>

			<li><code>K</code> displays the man page for the word under the
			cursor.</li>

			<li><code>l</code> moves the cursor one character to the right.
			Synonyms:<code>Right</code></li>

			<li><code>x</code> deletes the character under the cursor, storing
			it for later pasting. Synonyms: <code>DEL</code></li>

			<li><code>X</code> deletes the character to the left of the cursor,
			storing it for later pasting. Synonyms: <code>BACKSPACE</code></li>

			<li><code>c&lt;motion&gt;</code> deletes the motion, and goes into
			Insert Mode, thus allowing the 'changing' or replacement of a
			section of text.</li>

			<li><code>C</code> deletes from the cursor to the end of the
			current line, and goes into Insert Mode.</li>

			<li><code>v</code> starts visual mode.</li>

			<li><code>V</code> starts line oreiented visual mode.</li>

			<li><code>CTRL-v</code> start rectangular or block visual
			mode.</li>

			<li><code>b</code> moves the cursor to the beginning of the current
			word (alphanumeric) or the beginning of the previous word if
			already at the beginning of the current word.</li>

			<li><code>B</code> moves the cursor to the beginning of the current
			word (whitespace) or the beginning of the previous word if already
			at the beginning of the current word.</li>

			<li><code>n</code> searches for the next (in the direction of the
			current search) occurence of pattern.</li>

			<li><code>{</code> moves the cursor to the beginning of the current
			paragraph. When editing code, depending on the language, often
			jumps to the beginning of the code block.</li>

			<li><code>}</code> moves the cursor to the end of the current
			paragraph. When editing code, depending on the language, often
			jumps to the end of the code block.</li>

			<li><code>/</code> prompts for a pattern for which to search, and
			searches forwards for the next occurence of it in the file.</li>

			<li><code>?</code> prompts for a pattern for which to search, and
			searches backwards for the next occurence of it in the file.</li>

			<li><code>.</code> performs the last action again.</li>

		</ul>

		<p>One of the cooler things about Vim is the ability to specify counts.
		We can for example specify that one of the above actions indicated by
		keystroke be performed multiple times by prepending the keystroke with
		a number. For example if we wanted to insert exactly 72 '*' characters,
		instead of going into Insert Mode and counting, we simply type
		<code>72i*&lt;ESC&gt;</code>. Similarly we can replace the next 7
		characters with 'z's (<code>7rz</code>), etc...</p>

		<p>Also, in Command Mode, we have the ability to enter more complex
		commands by using the ':' key. The ':' key present us with a command
		prompt at the bottom left of the screen (':'), where we can type more
		complex commands, some of which are</p>

		<ul>

			<li><code>:q</code> quits Vim if there are no modified
			buffers.</li>

			<li><code>:w [&lt;filename&gt;]</code> writes the contents of the
			current buffer to the filename given, if one is given, otherwise
			back to the file from which the buffer was loaded.</li>

			<li><code>:e &lt;filename&gt;</code> opens a new buffer and loads
			the file specified into it for editing. If a buffer already exists
			for that file, then jumps to that buffer. If the current buffer has
			not been saved, an error message is produced, and the command does
			nothing.</li>

			<li><code>:read &lt;filename&gt;</code> reads the contents of the
			file specified and inserts them into the buffer after the current
			line, linewise.</li>

			<li><code>:help [&lt;command&gt;]</code> starts the help system,
			either at the table of contents if no command is specified, or at
			the page for the command given.</li>

			<li><code>:buffers</code> lists all the buffers open in Vim.</li>

			<li><code>:bn</code> switches to the next buffer if the current
			buffer hasn't been modified since the last save.</li>

			<li><code>:bp</code> switches to the previous buffer if the current
			buffer hasn't been modified since the last save.</li>

			<li><code>:bd</code> removes the current buffer, i.e. stops editing
			the current file, if the buffer hasn't been modified since the
			save.</li>

			<li>

				<code>:s/&lt;search pattern&gt;/&lt;replace
				pattern&gt;/&lt;options&gt;</code> searches for the first
				occurence of pattern on every line within the given range (or
				the current line only, if no range is given) and replaces it
				with the replacement pattern. Options can be

				<ul>
				
					<li><code>g</code> replace every pattern on a line, not
					just the first</li>

					<li><code>c</code> prompt for confirmation before repacing
					each pattern.</li>
				
				</ul>

			</li>

			<li><code>:source [&lt;filename&gt;]</code> loads and runs a script
			of vim commands from the file specified. This is how vim plugins
			are loaded.</li>

			<li><code>:!&lt;shell command&gt;</code> runs the shell command
			specified. If a range is given, the lines speicifed in the range
			will be piped to the shell command, and it's output will replace
			those lines.</li>

		</ul>

		<p>You will have noticed the concept of range in some some of the
		commands above. In general, we can specify that a particular command
		should be applied only to a certain range of lines, by entering that
		range as a pair of line numbers, comma separated as in <code>&lt;from
		line&gt;,&lt;to line&gt;</code>. '%' reflects the entire file as a
		range. Type ':help range' for more details, and there are lots more
		details.</p>

		<h2>Insert/Replace Mode</h2>

		<p>Insert Mode acts just as any other editor. What you type gets put
		into your file. The arrow keys work as normal, delete and backspace
		work as normal. The only two keys you need to worry about are
		<strong>Escape</strong> and <strong>Insert</strong>.  Escape takes you
		back to Command Mode. Insert will toggle between Insert proper and
		Replace or Overwrite Mode. When in Insert Mode you will always see the
		message "-- INSERT --" or "-- REPLACE --" displayed at the bottom left
		of the screen, depending on whether you are inserting or
		overwriting.</p>

		<p>A useful shortcut when in Insert Mode is <code>CTRL-X,CTRL-f</code>
		attempts to complete the word under the cursor as if it were a
		filename. The first available completion is used. You can cycle though
		available completions by holding down CTRL and pressing 'f' repeatedly.
		In versions 7 and higher of Vim, a little drop down menu is actually
		displayed when this happens.</p>

		<h2>Visual/Selection Mode</h2>

		<p>From Command mode one can highlight or select text to operate on
		using the visual ro selection modes, of which there are three. All oF
		them operate by highlighting from the cursor position when the mode is
		entered to the current cursor position, and show the message '-- VISUAL
		--' in the bottom left corner of the screen when we are in them.
		Exiting the mode by pressing Escape aborts the selection. Essentially
		the visual modes allow us to specify a range for ':' commands, or
		keystroke commands from command mode to work on. The three visual modes
		are</p>

		<ul>

			<li>Character Visual: where we can select from one character to any other character.</li>

			<li>Line Visual: where entire lines are selected.</li>

			<li>Block Visual: where a rectangular block on screen is selected.</li>
		
		</ul>

		<p>To exit any visual mode without doing anything we simply press
		Escape. However, we can also issue any of the commands from command
		mode when in visual mode. The command specified will be executed and
		then we will be returned to command mode. If that command operates only
		on entire lines, then all the lines selected, even if only partially
		selected, will be operated on. Otherwise the interactions of commands
		and selections are to lengthly to describe, although they tend to be
		resonably intuitive. All I can say is experiment.</p>

		<h2>Getting Help</h2>

		<p>The first place to get help for Vim is in Vim itself, using the
		<code>:help</code> command. Go though the tutorial at least once, and
		learn how to navigate the help system. Alternatively, an internet
		online copy is maintained at <a class="doclink"
		href="http://vimdoc.sf.net/">http://vimdoc.sf.net</a>. Other places
		include your local Vim guru, who may charge you in pizza or drinks
		(caffeinated or alcoholic). Finally, there's a whole collection of Vim
		gurus who sit on the #vim IRC channel on freenode.org. If you don't
		know how to use IRC, learn!</p>

		<h2>The Vim Debugger Plugin</h2>

		<p>I have written a plugin for Vim (shameless punting here, I know!)
		that makes Vim act like an IDE for the purposes of debugging python
		code. It's still under development, but is pretty stable, and should
		work fine. I use it regularly, without any issues. You can download it
		from <a
		href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1703">here</a>.
		Read the quick start file and go from there.</p>
