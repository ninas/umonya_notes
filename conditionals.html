		<h2>Booleans</h2>
		
		<p> Up to now, our programs have been pretty straightforward. The computer has simply executed each statement, in order, one after the other. There has been no variation, no change in behaviour, no awesomeness. In life, we are able to vary our behaviour based on our circumstances, i.e. we don't do <strong>exactly</strong> the same thing every day, day after day. Here are some everyday situations you might find yourself in, and some of the actions you might take as a  result:</p>

		<ul>

			<li>If it's raining or snowing for that matter, you won't go out, not without an umbrella at least.</li>

			<li>If it's dark and your lights are off, you'll turn them on, provided you're not trying to sleep.</li>

			<li>If you're hungry, and you have food at your disposal, or you have money to buy food, you'll eat something.</li>

		</ul>

		<p>We are capable of using our reasoning and intuition, when deciding what to do. Computers however don't have intuition, and the only reasoning they have is the reasoning <strong>you</strong> provide them with.
		When analysing a situation we are capable of taking various complicated aspects into consideration. For example:</p>
		<ul>
			<li> How badly do I want to?</li>
			<li> How many people we be there?</li>
			<li> How wet will I get?</li>
			<li> How much trouble will I get into?</li>
		</ul>
		<p> Computers on the other hand can not. Whilst we can weigh up different pros and cons and are capable of bending our own rules and even after hours of deliberating we're still capable of remaining unsure, a computer decides either yes or no. There are no in-between feelings, doubts or changing its mind.
		The logic computers use to make their decisions is called boolean logic. For a computer, something can only have two states, <strong>True</strong> or <strong> False</strong>. A computer will ask these questions instead:</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Do I want to?</li>
			<li> Will there be more than 5 people there?</li>
			<li> Will I get wet?</li>
			<li> Will I get into trouble?</li>
		</ul>		
		<p> A computer can analyse certain conditions, determine if they are true or false, and then act accordingly. There is no room for leeway, no randomness, the computer is always sure that what it's doing is correct. How does it know that it's correct? Because you told it it was.</p>

		<p>In addition to computers only being aware of two conditions,
		programming languages generally have very few ways of determining what
		those conditions are and acting upon them. Lets have a look at that second example, "Will there be more than 5 people there":<p>
		<pre class='listing'>
>>> numOfPeople=7
>>> numOfPeople>5
True
>>> numOfPeople=-3
>>> numOfPeople>5
False
>>> numOfPeople=5
>>> numOfPeople>5
False
>>> 

		</pre>
		<p>In the above example, we set the numOfPeople first to 7, then to -3 then to 5. See how the expression <code>numOfPeople>5</code> only returns <code>True</code> when the value stored in the expression is <strong>more</strong> than 5, and returns <code>False</code> otherwise.

		<p>'True' and 'False' are special words to python, known as
		<strong>reserved words</strong>, meaning they have been reserved for a
		particular purpose. Other reserved words we have encountered include
		'print', and 'if'. The complete list of python's reserved words can be
		found <a class="doclink"
		href="http://olympiad.cs.uct.ac.za/docs/python-docs-2.6/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords">here</a>.</p>

		<p>Note that when forming our proposition we used a specific operator,
		the greater than sign ('&gt;'). When forming propositions we can use a
		specific set of operators, called <strong>comparison
		operators</strong>. If both 'a' and 'b' are expressions of any
		type:</p>

		<ul>

			<li><code>a == b</code> proposes Equivalence. Is 'a' equal to 'b'?
			<strong>Note the double equals</strong>. In python '=' means
			assignment, and '==' means is 'a' equal to 'b'?.</li>

			<li><code>a != b</code> proposes Non-equivalence. Is 'a' not equal
			to 'b'?</li>

			<li><code>a &lt; b</code> proposes Less Than. Is 'a' less than
			'b'?</li>

			<li><code>a &gt; b</code> proposes Greater Than. Is 'a' greater
			than 'b'?</li>

			<li><code>a &lt;= b</code> proposes Less Than OR Equal To. Is 'a'
			less than or equal to 'b'?</li>

			<li><code>a &gt;= b</code> proposes Greater Than OR Equal To. Is
			'a' greater than or equal to 'b'?</li>

			<li><code>a in b</code> proposes that the <strong>string</strong> a
			is a substring of, i.e. exists <strong>in</strong>side, the
			<strong>string</strong> 'b'. This can also be used in lists as Marco will explain later.

		</ul>

		<p>Propositions, being expressions themselves, follow the usual rules
		for composition of expressions. This means that we can have an
		expression, <code>(x &gt; 3) == (y &lt; 4)</code>, in which we have two
		propositions 'x &gt; 3' and 'y &lt; 4' which have been composed into
		the total expression by using the third proposition which proposes that both sides have the same value. The entire proposition is true only if both the
		sub-propositions have the same truth value at the time the expression
		is evaluated.</p>

		<p>So back to our program to decide if we want to go to the party, we don't want to go to lame parties with too few people. So we only go to the party if there are more than 5 people there, i.e. if <code>numOfPeople&gt;5</code>. But what if we don't like crowded parties either? We could evaluate if <code>numOfPeople&lt;40</code>, so as to avoid parties with more than 40 people. But if only there were a way to combine them, so that we only go to parties that have a couple people <strong>AND</strong> are not too crowded. Say hello to <strong>logical operators</strong>, also known
		as <strong>boolean operators</strong> (operators which apply to boolean expressions). There
		are only three logical operators, listed below. If 'expr1' and 'expr2'
		are both propositions:</p>

		<ul>

			<li><code>expr1 and expr2</code> is True if both 'expr1'
			<strong>and</strong> 'expr2' are True when the proposition is
			evaluated.</li>

			<li><code>expr1 or expr2</code> is True if either 'expr1'
			<strong>or</strong> 'expr2' are True when the proposition is
			evaluated.</li>

			<li><code>not expr1</code> is True if 'expr1' is False, and <i>vice
			versa</i>.</li>

		</ul>
		<p> You can use boolean operators to string together multiple statements. e.g. to decide whether or not to go to a party you might use the following conditions</p>
		<p><code>numOfPeople>5 <strong>and</strong> numOfPeople&lt;40 <strong>and</strong> (day=='Friday' <strong>or</strong> day=='Saturday')</code></p>
		<p> This will produce true if the party has between 5 and 40 people, and it's either a Friday or a Saturday. <strong>Note the brackets around the parts next to the or</strong>. Brackets are used here to define which expression to evaluate first. This is because the evaluation of boolean algebra also follows a hierarchic system, </strong>BODMASCNAO.</strong> Your standard operations on numbers and variables come first. Then comes your conditions (>,==,<,in) then comes <strong>not</strong> then <strong>and</strong> and finally comes <strong>or</strong>. So if we left out the brackets and only had: </P
		<p><code>numOfPeople>5 <strong>and</strong> numOfPeople&lt;40 <strong>and</strong> day=='Friday' <strong>or</strong> day=='Saturday'</code></p>
		<p> This could be interpreted as yes if the party has between 5 and 40 people and it's a Friday, or it's a Saturday (In which case the number of people doesn't matter). Hence it's very important to get your BODMAS right else you're going to be going to lame parties with only 2 other people, just because it's a Saturday. Lets look at some examples:</p>
		<pre class='listing'>		
>>> 3>4 and 25==20
False
>>> a=2==1 or 4+2>=6 and  not 5%2==0
>>> a
True
>>> b=True and 1==1 and (3!=3 or 14-2>5 and 5==2*2)
>>> b
False
>>> 'ell' in "Hello There"
True
>>> b or a and 4&lt;=3
False
>>> a or b or 2!=2
True
>>>
		</pre>
		<p><i>Note how in that example we stored the result of a boolean expression to a variable (variables a and b), and when we called them later they acted just like any other boolean expression.</i><br> So now we know how to determine from a set of conditions whether or not something is true. We know whether or not to go to the party, but that isn't the end of the story: we have to actually use that information to do something about it.</p>
	
		<p>Python specifically has three methods to act upon such information, the most prevalent of which is the <a class="doclink"
		href="http://olympiad.cs.uct.ac.za/docs/python-docs-2.6/reference/compound_stmts.html#if">if statement</a>. Put the
		following in a file called 'second.py':</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
x = raw_input("Enter a number: ")
if x &gt; '3':
    print "You entered", x
    print "'x' is larger than 3"
</pre>

		<p>Now run your program using <code>python second.py</code> and enter
		'2' when prompted.</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
sirlark@hephaestus ~/scratch $ python second.py 
Enter a number: 2
</pre>

		<p>Hmmmm! Why didn't our print statements execute? If, as we believe,
		the program executes from top to bottom, the print statements should
		have been executed. Obviously, that <code>if x &gt; '3':</code> is
		doing something we are unaware of, so let's experiment a little more.
		Run the program again, but this time enter '5' at the prompt.</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
sirlark@hephaestus ~/scratch $ python second.py 
Enter a number: 5
You entered 5
'x' is larger than 3
</pre>

		<p>Okay! Our program just acted differently based on the input we gave
		it, or rather, based on the conditions determined by the input. Looking
		back at the last three lines of our program, there's a lot of new stuff
		in there that needs explanation, so we'll break it down. The if
		statement takes the format:</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
if &lt;expression&gt;:
    statement
    statement
    ...
</pre>

		<p>What 'if' does, is check whether the expression provided has a value
		of <em>True</em>, and if so, the statement immediately following the 'if' is
		executed, otherwise it is not executed. 
		Taking our previously expressed English examples:</p>

		<ul>

			<li><em>If</em> there are between 5 and 40 people, and it's either a Friday or a Saturday, then <strong> go to the party</strong>
			<li><em>If</em> you'll get wet, <strong>don't go outside</strong></li>
			<li><em>If</em> it's dark in your room, and the lights are off, <strong>turn them on</strong></li>
		</ul>

		<p>We can now express them in python as follows</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
if numOfPeople>5 and numOfPeople&lt;40 and (day=='Friday' or day=='Saturday'):
    whatYoureDoing="going to the party"
</pre>

		<pre class='listing'>
if weather=='Raining' and 'raincoat' not in thingsImWearing: 
    pass #In other words, don't go outside
</pre>
<pre class='listing'>
if dark and lightSwitch='off':
	print "Go turn on your light"
</pre>
		<p>Note the statement <code>pass</code>. Pass
		is another reserved word in python, and means quite simply 'do
		nothing'. We need it because 'if statements' <strong>require</strong> a
		statement to execute if the expression they evaluate is True.</p>

		<h3>Pitfalls in Translation</h3>

		<p>We need to be aware of some common pitfalls that we will encounter
		when translating English language logic (forgive the oxymoron) into
		mathematical or computer logic. Examine the following examples:</p> 

		<ul>

			<li>English: If both first name and surname are not blank<br />
			<span class='red'>
				Wrong: if firstname and surname != ''
			</span><br />
			<span class='green'>
				Correct: if (firstname != '') and (surname != '')
			</span></li>

			<li>English: If the premises contain more than 3 persons and no
			children or pets - <i>This is actually a very ambiguous statement</i><br>
			<span class='red'>
				Wrong: if adults > 3 and children or pets =	0
			</span><br />
			<span class='green'>
				Correct: if persons > 3 and (children == 0 and pets == 0)
			</span></li>

			<li>English: If the type is not 5 or 6<br />
			<span class='red'>
				Wrong: if type != 5 or 6
			</span><br />
			<span class='green'>
				Correct: if type != 5 and type != 6<br>
				Correct: if not (type==5 or type==6)	
			</span></li>

		</ul>

		href="http://olympiad.cs.uct.ac.za/docs/python-docs-2.6/reference/expressions.html#Booleans">python documentation

		<h2>Executing Multiple Statements Conditionally</h2>

		<div class="summary">

			What 'if' does, is check whether the expression provided has a
			value of <em>True</em>, and if so, the statement immediately
			following is executed, otherwise it is not executed.

		</div>

		<p>Examining what we said previously, we notice nasty phrases like 'the
		statement', indicating one, singular, statement. However, most of the
		time we'll have a number of statements that we'll only want to execute when certain
		conditions have been met. Python, like most programming languages,
		provides us with the ability to group collections of statements into
		<strong>blocks</strong>, much like composition of expressions. Such
		blocks can be treated as a single statement for the purposes of if
		statements, and others we will encounter soon.</p>

		<p>Unlike most other languages python allows us to specify blocks using
		<strong>indentation</strong> <i>(Spacing)</i>. Lines of code that have the same
		indentation are considered to be members of the same block. Blocks can
		also be <strong>nested</strong> inside one another, such lines
		constituting inner blocks are also members of their encompassing outer
		blocks. This is best illustrated using an example. (line numbers are
		not part of the code)</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
  1: #this program takes three numbers as input, and counts how many of
  2: #those numbers is even, and how many even numbers are negative
  3: #if an even number is entered, if it is negative, a message is printed
  4: 
  5: #set the counts for even and negative to 0
  6: even = 0
  7: negative = 0
  8: 
  9: #get the first number
 10: first = int(raw_input("Enter the first number: "))
 11: if first % 2 == 0:
 12:     print "The first number is even"
 13:     even = even + 1
 14:     if first &lt; 0:
 15:         print "The first number is negative"
 16:         negative = negative + 1
 17: 
 18: #get the second number
 19: second = int(raw_input("Enter the second number: "))
 20: if second % 2 == 0:
 21:     print "The second number is even"
 22:     even = even + 1
 23:     if second &lt; 0:
 24:         print "The second number is negative"
 25:         negative = negative + 1
 26: 
 27: #get the third number
 28: third = int(raw_input("Enter the third number: "))
 29: if third % 2 == 0:
 30:     print "The third number is even"
 31:     even = even + 1
 32:     if third &lt; 0:
 33:         print "The third number is negative"
 34:         negative = negative + 1
 35: 
 36: print "There were", even, "even numbers and", negative, "of those were negative"
</pre>

		<p>Running this program and giving the numbers 2, -4, and 7 as input
		produces</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
sirlark@hephaestus ~/scratch $ python illus.py 
Enter the first number: 2
The first number is even
Enter the second number: -4
The second number is even
The second number is negative
Enter the third number: -7
There were 2 even numbers and 1 of those were negative
</pre>

		<p>Firstly, let's get the indentation and nesting thing out of the way.
		Looking at lines 12 through to 16 we see they are more indented than
		the if statement on line 11. Thus these lines form a block of
		statements. Since this block is immediately after an if statement, all
		the statements in the block will only be executed if the if statement's
		expression is True. For the first number we gave as input (2), this is
		the case, so we start executing the block. When we get to line 14 we
		encounter a second if statement. This second if statement is
		<strong>nested</strong> inside the first, because it will only be
		executed if the outer if statement (line 11) has an expression that
		evaluates to True. Lines 15 and 16 form a <strong>nested
		block</strong>, but are not executed because 2 is not negative, or more
		specifically because 2 is not less than 0. Conversely, lines 24 and 25
		will be executed because -4 is less than 0. Although -7 is negative, lines 33 and 34 won't be executed, because the if statement on line 32 is part of the block from 30-34 that never gets executed</p>

		<p>Despite the fact that this example is an order of magnitude larger
		than any previous examples, there are only two new things. The first
		being indentation and nesting, the second being the use of
		<code>int()</code> around our raw_input functions.  Remember that
		raw_input() returns a string. So even if the user types in 2,
		raw_input() returns not 2 but the string '2'. Strings and numbers don't
		really play nice together, especially when they're being compared to
		one another, so we need to convert the string into an integer. This is
		known as <strong>type casting</strong> or <strong>coercion</strong>. We
		can do it for any basic python type ...</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
&gt;&gt;&gt; float("3.1415")
3.1415
&gt;&gt;&gt; str(143)
'143'
&gt;&gt;&gt; bool(None)
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; bool(-1)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; int(1.4142)
1
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

		<h2>Nested ifs vs complex boolean expressions</h2>
		<p> Lets re-examine our party scenario. We could use nested <em>if</em>s to specify when to go to the party as such:</p>
		<pre class='listing'>
if numOfPeople>5:
	if numOfPeople&lt;40:
		if day=='Friday':
			print "Go to party"
		if day=='Saturday':
			print "Go to party"
		</pre>
		<p> This method will work, but it is cumbersome. Too many nested ifs can lead to confusion, and if you wanted to change your program later so that it printed "You should go to the party", you might change it in one place but not the other. As such it would be much better to write that algorithm as follows:</p>
		<pre class='listing'>
if numOfPeople>5 and numOfPeople&lt;40 and (day=='Friday' or day=='Saturday):
	print "Go to the party"
		</pre>
		<p> This is a much more elegant solution, and is preferable. You would only use nesting when you want to do slightly different things depending on the situation. When programming, less is more. <strong>You should almost always strive for less code</strong> (so long as the program still does what it should).<p>
		<h2>Specifying Execution Code for Alternate Conditions</h2>

		<p>So now we have a handle on basic if statements, we come up against
		the next hurdle. If our condition isn't met, our if block statements
		simply aren't executed. But what if we want something
		<strong>else</strong> executed instead of nothing when the condition
		isn't met. We could simply follow our first <em>if</em> with another <em>if</em> that has the opposite expression (using not), but this isn't a very elegant solution. Enter the <em>if ... else</em> statement.</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
1: first = int(raw_input("Enter a number: "))
2: if first % 2 == 0:
3:     print first, "is even"
4: else:
5:     print first, "is odd"
</pre>

		<p>Now, if 'first' is not even, the program will print a message saying
		it is odd, instead of doing nothing. The indentation is of key
		importance here again. Note that 'else' is at the same indentation
		level as the 'if' and is also followed by a colon (':'). The statement
		to be executed if 'first' is not even, on line 5, is known as the
		<strong>else clause</strong>, as the statement on line 3 is known as
		the <strong>if clause</strong>.</p>

		<p>Finally we have to deal with the case where things are not as clear
		cut, not so black and white.</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
 1: colour = raw_input("Enter the name of a colour: ")
 2: if colour == "Red":
 3:     print "Stop!"
 4: elif colour == "Orange":
 5:     print "Try to stop if possible."
 6: elif colour == "Green":
 7:     print "Go! Go! GO!"
 8: else:
 9:     print colour, "Stop! You're obviously drunk."
</pre>

		<p>Running this a couple of with various inputs we get</p>

		<pre class='listing'>
sirlark@hephaestus ~/scratch $ python illus.py 
Enter the name of a colour: Red
Stop!
sirlark@hephaestus ~/scratch $ python illus.py 
Enter the name of a colour: Green
Go! Go! GO!
sirlark@hephaestus ~/scratch $ python illus.py 
Enter the name of a colour: orange
Stop! You're obviously drunk.
sirlark@hephaestus ~/scratch $
</pre>

		<p>The first run things happen as expected; We get to line 2, the value
		of colour is <em>Red</em>, the expression for the if statement is True,
		we execute line 3 ... and then the program finishes! This is because
		line 4 is not part of the block constituting line 2's if clause,
		because it has a lower indentation level. Also line's 4, 6 and 8 are
		all still part of the same if statement. Let's look at the second run a
		little more closely to see what happens.</p>

		<p>We get to line 2, the value of colour is <em>Green</em>.
		<em>Green</em> is not equal to <em>Red</em>, so we don't execute line
		3. Instead we jump to the else ... hang on! What is 'elif'? 'elif' is
		short for 'else if' and allows one to set up alternate conditions if
		earlier conditions haven't been met. So we get to the 'elif' on line 4.
		<em>Green</em> is not <em>Orange</em> so we don't execute line 5, instead we go onto line 6, which is still part of the same if-else group. <em>Green</em> is equal to <em>Green</em> so that will return true and we will run line 7.</p>

		<p>The third run illustrates nicely that in fact strings in python are
		case sensitive too. Not just the language, but the data we manipulate
		with it is considered case sensitive. 'Orange' and 'orange' are different
		strings, hence neither the if, nor any of the elifs execute. As a last resort, the block after the else executes.</p>

			prints the largest even number entered, and displays a suitable error message if no even numbers are entered, or if there is no one largest number (i.e. if the two biggest numbers are the same)</li>

			<li>Write a program that reads in a sentence and a keyword and tells you if that keyword is in that sentence.</li>

			<li>Write a program that asks the user to enter a four digit year,
			and prints out whether that year is a leap year or not. Hint: It's a leap year if the year is divisible by four, except if it's divisible by 100, in which case it's not, except if it's divisible by 400, in which case it is. i.e. 1900 was not a leap year but 2000 was</li>
			
			 <li>Write a program that asks for the names, and the birthdays of two people. (Ask for year, month and then date of birth)The program must determine which of the two people is oldest.</li>

			<li>Write a program that asks the user to enter 3 names, then
			outputs them sorted alphabetically.</li>
			
			<li>
<pre class='listing>
inport random
a=random.randrange(10)
print a
</pre> The above code prints a random number between 0 and 10. Use the above code in a program that asks the user to guess what number the computer is "thinking of". Then tell the user if he was right, or wrong, and if so, whether his guess was too high or too low.</i>


			<li>Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then
			prints out all the numbers from 1 to 10 by which the entered number
			is divisible.</li>
			
			<li>Think about that last program you wrote and how much of the code was repeated. Write a better version of the same program in your own pseudo-code.
