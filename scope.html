		Variable Scope</h1>

		<h2>The Concept of Scope</h2>

		<p>The concept of scope refers to the idea that variables have a
		limited availability according to the block of statements in which they
		were originally defined. We could say that the structure of blocks of
		statements in a Python program resembles set of bulleted lists lying
		variously within one another. On the outside we have our number list
		(our 'main block'), and all other lists (blocks), are contained
		therein, either directly or sub-contained within another inner
		block.</p>

		<div class="centered">

			<strong>The scope of a variable is the set of blocks within which
			it is available, i.e. defined.</strong>

		</div>

		<p>The outermost block, i.e. our main program, or everything beginning
		in column 1 of our code, is generally referred to as <strong>the global
		scope</strong>.</p>

		<h2>Pythons Golden Exception err... Rule</h2>

		<p>Python in general sets the scope of a variable to be the block in
		which it is defined and consequently all blocks inside of that block,
		to any arbitrary level.  This means that if some variable 'a' has been
		defined in a block, and I wish to use it's value in that block or any
		other block inside of that block, I can. 'a' will be there.</p>

		<p>One analogy is that of the program as a large open room. Variables
		are slips of paper on which values are written on one side, and the
		variables' names on the other. Whenever we need the value of a
		variable, for example when a variable is referenced in an expression,
		we can quickly scan through the papers in the room for the one with the
		right name, and read the value off the other side. But when we call a
		function, it's like putting up a wall of one way glass that divides the
		room in half, behind us as we walk into the function's area. We can
		look back through the glass, and still see all the papers that were in
		the room originally, and thus their names and values, but someone
		standing on the other side can't see any papers we may use inside the
		function enclosure, i.e. variables assigned values in the function.
		When we exit the function, and take down the glass wall in doing so, we
		also destroy all the papers used on the inside of the wall.</p> 

		<p>More <a class="doclink"
		href="http://docs.python.org/ref/naming.html">formally</a> speaking,
		when a name (i.e. not a reserved word, number, string or symbol) is
		encountered Python looks for the most recent definition of the
		variable, object, or function that has that name in the current block
		(i.e. the block in which execution is currently happening), and failing
		finding a definition in the current block will search outwardly in a
		block wise fashion to the outermost block.</p>

		<p>Note that the fact that the <strong>most recent</strong> definition
		is searched for means that if an assignment is made (essentially a
		re-definition) in the current block (<strong>known as the local
		block</strong>) overrides a definition or value assigned in an outer
		block, <strong>even before the assignment is encountered</strong>.</p>

		</div>

		<p>In the example above we are looking at the variables and their
		respective scope. The scope of a variable is indicated by its colour.
		Variables of a particular colour are available only in the block of
		that colour, and that block's inner blocks. The two inner blue blocks
		are separate from one another, as are their respective inner green
		blocks. In the green blocks, when the variable 'height' is encountered,
		python tries to find height's value within the green block. When it
		can't find it, it tries the next block outwards, namely the blue block,
		and failing there, finally tries the last block (the yellow one, where
		it finds height. If Python fails to find a value in the outermost
		block, it cause an error, stating that the variable has not been
		defined.  Hence, 'height', for example, is yellow, because it was
		defined in the yellow block by it's initial assignment. Similarly 'i'
		is blue, and <strong>unavailable</strong> in the yellow block, and the
		other blue block. 'total_height' is yellow, except in the green blocks,
		where it occurs in yellow and green, but why? The assignment statement
		in the green blocks causes 'total_height' to be redefined, so python
		knows to look for its value only in the green block in question, and
		when it can't find it there causes an error ('total_height' not
		defined) because it assume you are try to access 'total_height's value
		before assigning it an initial value. In fact the fact that there is an
		assignment in the green block causes 'total_height' to become a totally
		new variable unrelated to the original one, which only exists in the
		green block.  This effect is consistent throughout the green block,
		even before the assignment statement has been executed.</p>

		<h2>Forcing Global Scope for a Particular Variable</h2>

		<p>To override python's redefinition effect applied to 'total_height'
		we can tell Python explicitly to use the 'total_height' variable from
		outside the local block. We do this by declaring that variable name to
		be global, using the <strong>global statement</strong>, which takes the
		form <code>global &lt;variable name&gt;</code>. The global statement
		tells Python to use the innermost variable of the given name, instead
		of creating a new locally available variable. So let's change our
		program slightly so does what we expect, i.e. doesn't break, and counts
		the total number of lines outputted as a square or triangle.</p>

			<span class='blue'>#!/usr/bin/python<br />
			#A script to illustrate variable scope in python</span><br />
			<br />
			<span class='yellow'>total_height</span> = 0<br />
			<br />
			<strong>def</strong> triangle():<br />

			<div>
				<strong>def</strong> inc_total_height():<br />

				<div>
					<strong>global</strong> <span class='yellow'>total_height</span><br />
